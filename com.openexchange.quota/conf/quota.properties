# The quota properties

# Specifies the quota for the number of appointments that are allowed being created within a single context (tenant-wise scope).
#
# The purpose of this quota is to define a rough upper limit that is unlikely being reached during normal operation.
# Therefore it is rather supposed to prevent from excessive item creation (e.g. a synchronizing client running mad),
# but not intended to have a fine-grained quota setting. Thus exceeding that quota limitation will cause an appropriate
# exception being thrown, denying to further create any appointment in affected context.
#
# Default is -1 (unlimited)
