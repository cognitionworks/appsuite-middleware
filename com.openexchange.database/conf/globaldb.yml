# Configures connection parameters for the global, cross-context database.
#
# By default, no database is configured, so that features that require access
# to the cross-context database are not available.
#
# For each cross-context database, the schema name as well as the read- and 
# write-pool identifiers need to be specified. Please ensure that the same
# configuration file is used for all nodes in the cluster.
# 
# In most cases, it's sufficient to configure the same connection settings 
# for the whole user base of the installation. For that purpose, the "default"
# section is used, and no further configuration steps are necessary after the 
# referenced database has been registered.
#
# For setups serving multiple different "brands" or "domains", one or more 
# contexts can be classified into a specific "group". The association with
# the group is done by assigning the property "com.openexchange.context.group"
# to a context via config cascade. A context may only be part of one group,
# contexts without group association automatically fall into the "default"
# group. 
#
# Having contexts separated into different groups also allows to use different
# connection parameters for the global database as defined in the additional 
# sections of this configuration file. Context groups are bound to each
# configuration section by specifying the group name in the "groups" array. 
# Each group name can only be specified in one section. The name of each
# configuration block may be chosen freely, yet the referenced group names 
# have to match the actual values assigned to the contexts via 
# "com.openexchange.context.group".
#
# Besides using different connection parameters for the cross-context 
# database, the context group names also serve as differentiating key for 
# various data held in the global databases. For example, data of a guest 
# user that was invited to a share in one context of a group can be used 
# throughout all other contexts of the same group. Or, there may be a 
# different set of registered OAuth applications available for each context 
# group.

# Section for the "default" global database, uncomment and define the 
# connection settings for the default context-wide database here.
# default:
#
#     groups: [default]
#     id:  

# Example for an additional configuration setting that directs all data from 
# the context groups "de", "fr" and "nl" to this database schema. As outlined
# above, contexts may be assigned to those groups via config cascade.
#
# central_europe:
#     groups: [de, fr, nl]
#     readPoolId: 453
#     writePoolId: 455
#     schema: ox_europe
