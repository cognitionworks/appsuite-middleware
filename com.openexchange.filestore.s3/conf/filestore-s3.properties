# Configuration file for S3 file storages


# This file provides the configuration of all file storages based on the
# Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Each registered storage is 
# identified by a so called "filestore ID", which refers to the authority 
# part of the URI configured in the "uri" column in the "filestore" table of
# the config database, previously registered using
# "./registerfilestore -t [filestoreID]".
#
# A registered filestore is supposed to denote an according S3 bucket as its
# storage target, as well as being mapped to a configured "client". The client
# effectively defines a runtime instance of an "AmazonS3" instance of the S3
# Java Client SDK.
#
# For each configured client, an own set of the properties may be defined, 
# replacing [clientID] with the actual identifier. Refer to the following 
# template for available configuration options, or further down for a simple 
# example.


# == Template ================================================================

# Specifies the endpoint (e.g. "ec2.amazonaws.com") or a full URL, including 
# the protocol (e.g. "https://ec2.amazonaws.com") of the region specific AWS 
# endpoint this client will communicate with. Defaults to "s3.amazonaws.com" 
# if not defined.
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].endpoint=

# Configures the Amazon S3 region to use when creating new buckets. This value
# is also used to pre-configure the client when no specific endpoint is set.
# Possible values are "us-gov-west-1", "us-east-1", "us-west-1", "us-west-2", 
# "eu-west-1", "eu-central-1", "ap-southeast-1", "ap-southeast-2", 
# "ap-northeast-1", "sa-east-1", "cn-north-1". Defaults to "us-west-2".
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].region=us-west-2

# Defines if path-style-access should be used when accessing the S3 API. If 
# not set to "true", virtual-hosted-style access is used. Please refer to
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html for 
# details. Defaults to "true".
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].pathStyleAccess=true

# Configures the AWS access key to use.
# This property is required provided that property "com.openexchange.filestore.s3.[filestoreID].credentialsSource" is set to "static".
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].accessKey=

# Configures the AWS secret key to use.
# This property is required provided that property "com.openexchange.filestore.s3.[filestoreID].credentialsSource" is set to "static".
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].secretKey=

# Optionally specifies which client-side encryption should be used. Current 
# options include "none" for no encryption, or "rsa" for an RSA-based asymmetric
# encryption. Defaults to "none".  
# Please note that depending on the used key length and Java runtime, one 
# might need to replace the so-called "JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction 
# Policy Files" accordingly.
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].encryption=none

# Specifies the path to the local keystore file (PKCS #12) containing the 
# public-/private-key pair to use for encryption, e.g. 
# "/opt/open-xchange/etc/cert/awss3.p12". Required if 
# "com.openexchange.aws.s3.[filestoreID].encryption" is set to "rsa".
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].encryption.rsa.keyStore=

# Specifies the password used when creating the referenced keystore containing
# public-/private-key pair to use for encryption. Note that blank or null 
# passwords are in violation of the PKCS #12 specifications. Required if 
# "com.openexchange.aws.s3.[filestoreID].encryption" is set to "rsa".
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].encryption.rsa.password=

# Optionally configures an override for the algorithm used to sign requests
# against the S3 interface. If left empty, the underlying client will choose a 
# suitable signer type based on the actually used service and region 
# automatically, however, auto-detection only works properly for the "vanilla" 
# Amazon S3, and may lead to unwanted results when targeting an S3 
# implementation where not all signature types are supported.
# Possible values include "S3SignerType" to enforce the AWS signature v2, and 
# "AWSS3V4SignerType" for AWS signature v4.
# For backwards compatibility, the setting defaults to "S3SignerType", and 
# needs to be adjusted explicitly when targeting the newer "v4-only" regions 
# like Frankfurt or Beijing.
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].signerOverride=S3SignerType

# Defines the chunk size to use for multipart-uploads. Uploads larger than 
# this size are splitted and uploaded into multiple requests. The value can be
# specified with one of the units "B" (bytes), "kB" (kilobyte), "MB"
# (Megabyte) or "GB" (Gigabyte), e.g. "10 MB". For AWS, the minimum size is 
# 5 MB, which is also the default value. 
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].chunkSize=5MB

# Specifies the names of the buckets this client serves. It is possible to apply
# wildcards and to specify multiple values as comma-separated list.
#
# For example 
#
# 'com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.myClient1.buckets=bucket1, bucket2'
#
# You can also use wildcards instead. For example:
#
# 'com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.myClient1.buckets=bucket*'
#
# It is also possible to use a combination of both:
# com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.myClient1.buckets=bucketA_*, bucketB_*
#
# This property is required.
com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].buckets=

# Maps a registered filestore to its bucket name and with that implicitely
# the client name to be used.
#
# This property is optional. It can be left away, if the according filestore ID
# is effectively the wanted bucket name and matches the 'com.openexchange.filestore.s3client.[clientID].buckets'
# value of a configured client.
#
# The bucket will be created automatically if it not yet exists, however, it's still possible to use an
# already existing one. There are some naming restrictions, please refer to 
# http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html for
# details.
#
# Required.
com.openexchange.filestore.s3.[filestoreID].bucketName=
