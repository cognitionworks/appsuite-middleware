# Defines the timespan after which an unused named guest user should be 
# removed from the system. "Unused" time starts after the last share to the 
# guest user has been revoked. This setting only affects "named" guest users,
# i.e. users that were invited explicitly and authenticate using their 
# e-mail-address.
# The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days), 
# "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours). Defaults to "2W" (two weeks), with a minimum 
# of "1D" (one day). A value of "0" disables the delayed guest user deletion, 
# so that guest users are deleted right after the last share to them was 
# removed.  
com.openexchange.share.cleanup.guestExpiry=2W

# Defines the interval of a periodic background task that performs 
# sharing-related cleanup operations like removal of expired shares or final
# deletion of no longer used guest users. The task is executed only once per 
# interval in the cluster, so this value should be equally defined on each
# node.
# The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days), 
# "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours). Defaults to "1D" (one day), with a minimum 
# of "1H" (one hour). A value of "0" disables the periodic background task.
com.openexchange.share.cleanup.periodicCleanerInterval=1D

# Specifies the quota for the number of shares that are allowed being created 
# by one user.
# A value <= 0 means unlimited.
# This value can be overwritten by setting specific values for context sets.
# Default is 150
