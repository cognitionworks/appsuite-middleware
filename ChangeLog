  - Added a handy new sub package to allow for bulk entries of contacts,
    found in ...contacts.helpers. Might seem a bit strange to use, but
    Hibernate does it kinda he same way. You'll get used to it.
  - Added two basic CSV handling classes - one of them a parser. Can be found
    in ...importerexporter.csv - maybe useful for other projects.
  - Further Work on importers and exporters. Okay, we agreed not to mention 
    new development, but since I was already typing and even the 
    system.properties.in has been updated, which usually is worth an e-mail...
