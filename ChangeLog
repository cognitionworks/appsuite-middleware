 - Fixed bug #6031: Better html2text conversion concerning paragraph
   elements "<p>"
 - Replaced "int foo = new Integer(str).intValue()" constructs with
   invocation of faster routine "int foo = Integer.parseInt(str)": Avoids
   unnecessary instantiation of Integer objects.
 - Changed permission for folder 'Global Address Book' formerly known as
   'Internal Users'
 - Fixed bug #6274: Changed error message as demanded: login to imap server
   failed, please try again later.

 - Fixed bug #4928	OX Global Address Book vs. Internal Users
   Fixed through changes made in FolderStrings.java. Last thing to do is translation

   Fixed through additional null-check in MailInterfaceImpl.java (line 1704)
 - Fixed bug #6048	Email: Emails without display name aren't sorted by sender (all views)
   Also checking for empty personal in MailComparator when comparing email addresses
 - Fixed bug #6229	Folder.actionGetUpdatedFolders Object was not returned
	Fixed through adding additional catch-clause when instantiating an instance of
	FolderObjectIterator, cause no finally-block can be used to close used resource
 - Fixed bug #6230	Logging when missing default Drafts folder in user mail settings
   Fixed in class MailInterfaceImpl.java (line 472 through 508): Falling back to default
   values defined in UserSettingMail

  - Added a handy new sub package to allow for bulk entries of contacts,
    found in ...contacts.helpers. Might seem a bit strange to use, but
    Hibernate does it kinda he same way. You'll get used to it.
  - Added two basic CSV handling classes - one of them a parser. Can be found
    in ...importerexporter.csv - maybe useful for other projects.
  - Further Work on importers and exporters. Okay, we agreed not to mention 
    new development, but since I was already typing and even the 
    system.properties.in has been updated, which usually is worth an e-mail...
