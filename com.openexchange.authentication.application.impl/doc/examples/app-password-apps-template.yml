# Example definitions of available applications, together with their corresponding scope-definitions, 
# that can be used with app-specific passwords. 
# 
# This template contains examples and will be overwritten during updates. To use, copy this file to 
# /opt/open-xchange/etc/app-password-apps.yml and configure as needed.
#
# Each application needs an unique identifier, through which the app can be enabled for users through the 
# config-cascade- enabled setting "com.openexchange.com.openexchange.authentication.application.appTypes".
#
# See also https://documentation.open-xchange.com/latest/middleware/login_and_sessions/application_passwords.html
