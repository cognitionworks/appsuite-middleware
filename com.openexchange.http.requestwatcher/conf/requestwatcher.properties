# Requestwatcher.properties
#
# This file configures the requestwatcher contained in the package
# open-xchange-grizzly. The requestwatcher keeps track of incoming requests and
# periodically checks the age of the currently processing requests. If a request
# exceeds the configured maximum age, infos about the request and its processing
# thread are logged either into the configured logfiles or syslog depending on
# your configuration. After logging the infos the processing of the stalled
# request will be interrupted. 


# Enable/disable the requestwatcher and deployment of request reporting
# ServletFilter into the grizzly server. Default value: true (enabled).

# Define the requestwatcher's frequency in milliseconds. Default value: 30000.
