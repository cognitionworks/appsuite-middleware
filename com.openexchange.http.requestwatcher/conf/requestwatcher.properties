# Enable/Disable requestwatcher + deployment of reporting ServletFilter.
# The watcher is a timed task that checks every {c.o.h.r}.frequency if http
# requests are taking longer than {c.o.h.r}.maxRequestAge and interrupts the
# processing of that request.
# The ServletFilter is part of the {c.o.h}.grizzly bundle and only installed if
# isEnabled is set to true.
