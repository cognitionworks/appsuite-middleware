  This pages describes the configurable attributes that can be set to modify each HTTP client used by the Middleware to make requests against thrid parties.
  Each client can be configured for itself. Therefore simply use the service identifier of the desired service, e.g. "icalfeed", and replace "[serviceIdentifier]" with it.
  E.g. the property looks like "com.openenexchange.httpclient.icalfeed.readTimeout". For futher details please have a look at [[https://documentation.open-xchange.com/{{version}}/middleware/administration/http_client_configuration.html]] .
