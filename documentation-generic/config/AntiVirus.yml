    - key: com.openexchange.antivirus.mode
      description: |
        Dictates the operation mode of the service. In 'streaming' mode
        the data stream that will reach the end-point-client after will
        be coming from the ICAP/AV server. In 'double-fetch' mode the
        data stream will have to be fetched from the storage twice (one
        for scanning and one for delivering to the end-point-client).
        The streaming mode is still at an experimental phase.
      defaultValue: double-fetch
