      description: |
        The time in milliseconds a notification is queued in buffer to possible aggregate

      description: |
        The frequency/delay in milliseconds when the buffering queue will be checked for due
        notifications (the ones exceeding delayDuration in queue)
      default: 500

        Specifies the number of threads that concurrently handle due notifications that were transferred
        from buffering queue to processing queue.

    - key: com.openexchange.pns.transport.apn.ios.enabled
      description: |
        Specifies whether the APNS transport is enabled. That property is responsive to config-cascade
        and reloadable as well.

        Moreover, an even finer-grained decision is possible to be configured as a certain transport
        is checked for availability providing user, context, client and topic.
        Hence, it is possible to  specify:

        com.openexchange.pns.transport.apn.ios.enabled.open-xchange-appsuite.ox:calendar:new=false

        That allows the client "open-xchange-appsuite" (App Suite UI) to receive "new mail" notifications
        via APNS, but not for "new appointment".
