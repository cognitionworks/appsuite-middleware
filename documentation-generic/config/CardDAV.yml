      description: |
        A comma-separated list of folder IDs to exclude from the synchronization. 
        Use this to disable syncing of very large folders (e.g. the global address 
        list in large contexts, which always has ID 6). By default, no folders are
        excluded.

    - key: com.openexchange.carddav.exposedCollections
      description: |
        Controls which collections are exposed via the CardDAV interface. Possible 
        values are '0', '1' and '2'. A value of '1' makes each visible folder 
        available as a resource collection, while '2' only exposes an aggregated 
        collection containing  all contact resources from all visible folders. The 
        default value '0' exposes either an aggregated collection or individual 
        collections for each folder, depending on the client's user-agent that is 
        matched against the pattern in 'userAgentForAggregatedCollection'.

    - key: com.openexchange.carddav.userAgentForAggregatedCollection
      description: |
        Regular expression to match against the client's user-agent to decide 
        whether the aggregated collection is exposed or not. The default pattern 
        matches all known varieties of the Mac OS Addressbook client, that doesn't 
        support multiple collections. Only used if 'exposedCollections' is set to 
        '0'. The pattern is used case insensitive. 
      defaultValue: ".*CFNetwork.*Darwin.*|.*AddressBook.*CardDAVPlugin.*Mac_OS_X.*|.*Mac OS X.*AddressBook.*"

    - key: com.openexchange.carddav.userAgentForAggregatedCollection
      description: |
        Specifies if all visible folders are used to create the aggregated 
        collection, or if a reduced set of folders only containing the global 
        addressbook and the personal contacts folders should be used. This setting
        only influences the aggregated collection that is used for clients that
        don't support multiple collections. Possible values are 'true' and 'false.
