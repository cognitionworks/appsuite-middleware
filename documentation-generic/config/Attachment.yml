      description: |
        If the sum of all uploaded files (for contacts, appointments or tasks) in one request is larger than this value,
        the upload will be rejected. If this value is not set or -1, the more general MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE configured in
        server.properties will be used. If that value is 0 uploads will be unrestricted.
        The size is in Bytes.
