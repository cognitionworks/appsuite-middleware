        If the sum of all uploaded files in one request is larger than this value, the upload will be rejected.  
        If this value is not set or <code>-1</code>, the more general [[MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE]] configured in server.properties will be used.  
        If that value is <code>0</code> uploads will be unrestricted. The size is in Bytes.

    - key: com.openexchange.infostore.trash.retentionDays
      description: |
        Specifies how many days items are kept in the trash folder until they are
        finally deleted. Cleanup is triggered during user login. A value equal to or
        smaller <code>0</code> disables automatic cleanup for items in the trash folder.
        
        Depending on the "protected" flag of the corresponding preference path,
        users are able to change their configured value on their own. This can be
        adjusted via "/meta/infostore.yml".

        enabled for users that have the "infostore" permission set.

    - key: com.openexchange.infostore.autodelete.default.retentionDays
      description: |
        Specifies the default value to assume for how many days multiple versions of a Drive item/document
        are kept until they are automatically deleted. However, the current version is never deleted regardless
        of its age. Cleanup is triggered whenever a new versions is about to be added to an existent Drive
        item/document. A value equal to or less than <code>0</code> (zero) disables the auto-deletion by
        retention days.
        
        Users may set that value on their own if property "com.openexchange.infostore.autodelete.editable" signals
        "true", in which case this default value is no more considered.

      description: |
        Specifies the default value to assume for how many multiple versions of a Drive item/document are allowed
        to be maintained. If the number of versions for a Drive item/document exceeds that threshold, oldest ones
        are automatically deleted. Cleanup is triggered during user login. A value equal to or less than <code>0</code>
        (zero) disables the auto-deletion by max. allowed number of versions.
        
        Users may set that value on their own if property "com.openexchange.infostore.autodelete.editable" signals
