  Properties for infostore
properties:
    - key: MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE
      description: |
        If the sum of all uploaded files in one request is larger than this value, the upload will be rejected.
        If this value is not set or -1, the more general MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE configured in server.properties will be used.
        If that value is 0 uploads will be unrestricted. The size is in Bytes.
      defaultValue: 10485760

    - key: com.openexchange.infostore.zipDocumentsCompressionLevel
      description: |
        Configures the used compression level that is applied to .zip containers
        when downloading multiple documents at once. Possible values are "-1" for
        the built-in default level, "0" for no compression, or any number between
        "1" (best speed) and "9" (best compression).
      defaultValue: -1
      version: 
      reloadable: false
      configcascadeAware: false

    - key: com.openexchange.infostore.trash.retentionDays
      description: |
        Specifies how many days items are kept in the trash folder until they are
        finally deleted. Cleanup is triggered during user login. A value equal to or
        smaller "0" disables automatic cleanup for items in the trash folder.
        The default value configured here takes effect on server granularity, but
        can be overwritten for sets of contexts, single contexts and single users.
        See http://oxpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=ConfigCascade for more
        information.
        Depending on the "protected" flag of the corresponding preference path,
        users are able to change their configured value on their own. This can be
        adjusted via /meta/infostore.yml
      defaultValue: -1
