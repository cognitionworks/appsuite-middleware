        Configures whether blocking long polling for pushing synchronization events
        to clients may be used as fallback when no other long polling handlers are
        available due to missing support of the HTTP service. Handling long polling
        in a blocking manner consumes a server thread, and should therefore only be
        enabled for testing purposes.
