      description: |
        Enables/disables support for malicious folders.

        If enabled and a mail is fetched from a folder contained in listing configured through "com.openexchange.mail.maliciousFolders.listing" property, the mail's JSON representation contains an additional "malicious: true" field and possible HTML content is processed in the way to disable any hyper-links.

        I.e.
        "...&lt;a href="http://evil.com/click.me"&gt;Get something for free here&lt;/a&gt;..."
        is turned to
        "...&lt;a href="#" onclick"return false;" data-disabled="true"&gt;Get something for free here&lt;/a&gt;..."

      description: |
        Specifies the full paths for such mail folders in the primary account's folder tree that are supposed being considered as malicious and therefore a special treatment happens; e.g. hyper-links that occur in mail content are not displayed and/or are not clickable.

        The value is supposed to be comma-separated list of folder paths. An entry in the CSV list is either a full path of a folder in the primary mail account (e.g. "INBOX/Malware") or a reserved identifier denoting the standard folder and its sub-folders of every mail account (incl. Unified Mail). Supported reserved identifiers are: "$Spam", "$Drafts", "$Sent", "$Trash", "$Confirmed-spam", "$Confirmed-ham".

        Example: $Spam, INBOX/Malware
        Special treatment happens for standard Spam folder and for the "INBOX/Malware" folder in primary account's folder tree hierarchy.
      defaultValue: $Spam, $Confirmed-spam

    - key: com.openexchange.imap.greeting.host.regex
      description: |
        Specifies the regular expression to use to extract the host name/IP address information out of the greeting string advertised by primary
        IMAP server. Only applicable for primary IMAP server! Default is empty.

        The regular expression is supposed to be specified in Java notation: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html

        Moreover, either the complete regex is considered or in case a capturing group is present that group will be preferred.
        I.e. "Dovecot at ([0-9a-zA-Z._-]*) is ready", then the capturing group is supposed to extract the host name/IP addres information
