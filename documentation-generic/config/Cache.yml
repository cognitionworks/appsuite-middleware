properties:
    - key: com.openexchange.caching.jcs.enabled
      description: |
        Specify whether JCS-based caching should be enabled.

      reloadable: false
      configcascadeAware: false

      tags: ["Caching"]
    - key: com.openexchange.caching.jcs.eventInvalidation
      description: |
        Configures how remote cache invalidation is done. Set to <code>true</code> for cache events via the cache event messaging service, or to <code>false</code>
        to stick with the JCS-internal lateral auxiliary cache configuration.
      defaultValue: true
      version:
      reloadable: true
      configcascadeAware: false

    - key: com.openexchange.caching.jcs.remoteInvalidationForPersonalFolders
      description: |
        Specifies if changes to personal folders (personal in terms of non-global e.g. folders kept in database) are supposed to be propagated
        to remote nodes. This option is only useful for installations that do offer collaboration features or do not support session stickyness.
        For instance users are able to share mail folders or might be load-balanced to other nodes while active in a single session.
      defaultValue: false
      version:
      reloadable: true
      configcascadeAware: false

    - key: com.openexchange.caching.events.ms.topicCount
      description: |
        Number of topics to distribute cache events. Multiple topics cause a better usage of hazelcast workers (default is 5 workers) dispatching the events.
