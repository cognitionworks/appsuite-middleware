properties:
    - key: com.openexchange.http.grizzly.wsTimeoutMillis
      description: |
        Specifies the Web Socket timeout in milliseconds
      defaultValue: 900000
      version: 7.8.3
      reloadable: false
      configcascadeAware: false

    - key: com.openexchange.http.grizzly.sessionExpiryCheckInterval
      description: |
        Specifies the interval in seconds when to check for expired/invalid HTTP sessions
        This value should be aligned to property "com.openexchange.servlet.maxInactiveInterval"
        that defines how long (in seconds) a HTTP session may stay idle/inactive until considered
        as invalid
      defaultValue: 60
      version: 7.8.4
      reloadable: false
      configcascadeAware: false
      file: grizzly.properties
      tags: ["Session"]
    - key: com.openexchange.http.grizzly.maxNumberOfConcurrentRequests
      description: |
        Specifies the number of concurrent HTTP requests that are allowed being processed.
        Those requests exceeding that limit will encounter a 503 "The server is temporary overloaded..." status code and accompanying error page
        A value of less than or equal to 0 (zero) effectively disables that limitation.
        The chosen value for this property should be aligned to the configured "ulimit" of the backing operating system. E.g. having "ulimit" set
        to 8,192 (given that JVM is the only main process running for OS user) implies that ~6,000 should be considered for this property leaving
        some room for threads not associated with an HTTP request.
      defaultValue: 0
