array:
  - data:
      Key: com.openexchange.folderstorage.defaultPermissions
      Description: >
Specifies default permission to use in case folder is supposed to be created below a certain parent folder.
The value is a pipe ("&#124;") separated listing of expressions; each expression defines the default permissions
for a denoted parent folder. Currently the reserved folder identifiers "2" and "15" are considered as "2"
denoted the public PIM folder whereas "15" denotes the public Drive folder.

An expression starts with the parent folder identifier followed by '=' character; e.g. "2=".
Then there is a comma-separated list of permissions to assume per entity (user or group).

Each permission either starts with "user_", "admin_user_", "group_" or "admin_group_" (the prefix "admin_" controls
whether the entity is supposed to be set as folder administrator) followed by the numeric entity identifier.

Then an '@' character is supposed to occur and finally followed by rights expression. The rights may be dot-separated
listing (<folder-permission> + "." + <read-permission> + "." + <write-permission> + "." + <delete-permission>) or one
of the tokens  "viewer", "writer" or "author".

More formally
expressions = expression ("&#124;" expression)*
expression = folder "=" permission ("," permission)*
permission = ("admin_")? ("group_" &#124; "user_") entity(int) "@" rights
rights = (folder-permission(int) "." read-permission(int) "." write-permission(int) "." delete-permission(int)) &#124; ("viewer" &#124; "writer" &#124; "author")

Example
2=group_2@2.4.0.0,admin_user_5@8.4.4.4&#124;15=admin_group_2@8.8.8.8
2=group_2@viewer,admin_user_5@author&#124;15=admin_group_2@writer
