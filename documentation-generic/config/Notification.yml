      description: |
        Direct links for notifications are generated according to the following pattern.  
        [hostname] needs to be replaced with the hostname of your machine. This is done automatically by software on backend machines using the
        hosts canonical host name.  
        [uiwebpath] is replaced with the value of [[com.openexchange.UIWebPath]].  
        [module], [object] and [folder] are replaced with the relevant IDs to generate the direct link.
      defaultValue: https://[hostname]/[uiwebpath]#!!&app=io.ox/[module]&id=[object]&folder=[folder]
