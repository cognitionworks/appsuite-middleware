      Description: >
Allows to enable/disable spam handling per user/context/server via ConfigCascade (based on the configured spam handler).
If no configuration is available (for the mentioned property) the previously configured user setting mail permission bit will be taken into account. If there is a configuration for "com.openexchange.spamhandler.enabled" available these will be used for the defined scope 
<b>Caution:</b> if the property has been set via ConfigCascade only these source will be used. Changing the user configuration afterwards via /opt/open-xchange/sbin/changeuser ... --gui_spam_filter_capabilities_enabled true/false will have no effect! You can change it for instance on a user base as described here: http://oxpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=ConfigCascade . If you remove the property from ConfigCascade sources the formerly overwritten permission bit will be used.
