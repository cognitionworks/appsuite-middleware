array:
  - data:
      Key: com.openexchange.ipcheck.mode
      Description: >
Specifies the IP check mechanisms to apply.
Known values are: none, strict and countrycode
"none" implies that no IP check takes place at all
"strict" implies that IP addresses are checked for equality
"countrycode" requires open-xchange-geoip being installed and performs a plausibility check against IP addresses' country codes
Note: The "com.openexchange.IPCheck" property still has precedence over this property;
i.e. if "com.openexchange.IPCheck" is set to "true", strict IP check is enabled.
