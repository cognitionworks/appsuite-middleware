      description: |
        Specifies the IP check mechanisms to apply.
        Known values are: none, strict and countrycode
        "none" implies that no IP check takes place at all
        "strict" implies that IP addresses are checked for equality
        "countrycode" requires open-xchange-geoip being installed and performs a plausibility check against IP addresses' country codes
        Note: The "com.openexchange.IPCheck" property still has precedence over this property;
        i.e. if "com.openexchange.IPCheck" is set to "true", strict IP check is enabled.
        Default is empty
