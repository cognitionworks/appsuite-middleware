    - key: com.openexchange.passwordchange.showStrength
      description: |
        Configures whether to show a graphical indicator reflecting the strength of the current password or not. The strength is evaluated based on matching 
        performed against the pattern defined via "com.openexchange.passwordchange.regexp" during typing. Possible values are true to show the strength, or "false", otherwise. 
        Defaults to false .

    - key: com.openexchange.passwordchange.minLength
      description: |
         Specifies the minimum required length of a password entered by the user. Passwords shorter than the configured length are not accepted.

    - key: com.openexchange.passwordchange.maxLength
      description: |
         Specifies the maximum allowed length of a password entered by the user. Passwords longer than the configured length are not accepted. 
         A value of "0" disables the check and allows an unlimited length.   
      defaultValue: 0

    - key: com.openexchange.passwordchange.regexp
      description: |
         Configures a regular expression pattern to use when calculating the strength if indicating "com.openexchange.passwordchange.showStrength" is true ,
         i.e. any character not matching the pattern increases the displayed password strength.   
      defaultValue: "[^a-z0-9]"
      version: 
      reloadable: true
      configcascadeAware: true
      related: com.openexchange.passwordchange.showStrength

    - key: com.openexchange.passwordchange.special
      description: |
         Defines a string that is shown as an example of special characters that increase a passwords' strength. This should be a subset of characters 
         matched by the pattern defined at "com.openexchange.passwordchange.regexp".
      defaultValue: "$, _, or %"
      version: 
      reloadable: true

      tags: ["Password Change", "Password"]
    - key: com.openexchange.passwordchange.allowedPattern
      description: |
          Optionally configures a pattern to match the entered password against, i.e. only passwords matching this pattern will be accepted. Please note that the 
          pattern is used to perform a 'positive' test against the entire entered password, and only matching strings are accepted, so use appropriate quantifiers
          as needed. For example, if the backslash character '\' should not be permitted in passwords, a pattern could look like "[^\\\\]*", or, if only ASCII 
          characters should be allowed, the pattern "[\\x00-\\x7F]*" could be used (each without the quotation marks). By default, no pattern is configured, 
          i.e. all character sequences are allowed.

      version: 
      reloadable: true

    - key: com.openexchange.passwordchange.allowedPatternHint
      description: |
         Configures a string that is shown to users in an error message after trying to save a password not fulfilling the pattern defined in 
         "com.openexchange.passwordchange.allowedPattern". This text should explain  which characters are allowed according to the pattern, and is inserted 
         for "[...]" in the following error message: "The entered password is illegal and can't be saved. Allowed characters are: [...]". Required if 
         "com.openexchange.passwordchange.allowedPattern" is defined.
