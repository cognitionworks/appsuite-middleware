    - key: com.openexchange.soap.cxf.entityExpansionLimit
      description: |
        Java platform limits the number of entity expansions that are allowed for a single XML document.
        Default is 128000, which is considered to be a pretty large number for any real life application.
        
        However, if any application does need to have a higher limit, this property (which maps to 'entityExpansionLimit' system property)
        can be increased to the desired size. Setting it to 0 (zero) means unlimited.
      defaultValue: 128000
      version: 
      reloadable: false
      configcascadeAware: false

        This is a workaround for the known side-effect in CXF 2.7.x described in CXF-5737 issue (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-5737)
        The endpoint address gets manipulating after accessing it via multiple aliases.
        This is disabled by default in the upcoming versions of CXF.
