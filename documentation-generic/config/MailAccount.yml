feature_name: Mail Account
properties:
    - key: com.openexchange.mailaccount.failedAuth.limit
      description: |
        Specifies the max. number of failed authentication attempts until the associated mail account is disabled.

        Disabled accounts are unable to peform any requests (instead an error is thrown). Those accounts can be reactivated by updating the account (e.g. correcting the password).
        This feature only effects external accounts. In case of an unified account environment only mails for enabled accounts are retrieved. 

        Note:  
        This feature prevents unnecessary requests to external mail servers and therefore protects the own server to be blacklisted by those external servers because of 
        too many failing authentication attempts. This feature should therefore never be disabled by choosing a too big limit or a too short timespan.
