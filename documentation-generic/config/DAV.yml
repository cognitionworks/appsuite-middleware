      description: |
         Configures a static prefix for *DAV-servlets. Defaults to "/servlet/dav" for backwards compatibility.
         
         The prefix will be considered when the *DAV servlets are registered, as well when constructing paths to 
         *DAV resources and collections that are indicated to clients. The value should be set in accordance with 
         "com.openexchange.dav.proxyPrefixPath" in case the load balancer / proxy in front of the application server 
         forwards or rewrites client requests to a certain path. 
         
         Otherwise, when no special handling for *DAV requests is configured on the proxy-side, this value may also 
         be set to an arbitrary value like "/dav". 
      defaultValue: /servlet/dav/

      description: |
         Configures the prefix path that is used by the proxy / load balancer when forwarding requests to this 
         application server. Defaults to "/servlet/dav" for backwards compatibility. 
         
         For example, if a ProxyPass directive like the following is configured: 
            ProxyPass / balancer://oxserver-sync/servlet/dav/
         
         Or, if a RewriteRule has been set up to modify incoming queries like this:
            RewriteRule (.*)  http://localhost:8009/servlet/dav$1
         
         Then, the value "/servlet/dav" should be specified here. 
         
         The correct value is necessary to indicate the correct paths to *DAV clients in responses, which in turn 
         avoids duplicated prefix paths in case the proxy forwards or rewrites requests to a subpath, too. 
         
         Also, in case no special handling for *DAV requests is configured on the proxy-side, this value should be 
         set "/", meaning that client requests will be routed as-is to the application server.
