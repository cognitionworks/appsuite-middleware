    description: |
      Searching for contacts can be done in a single folder or globally across all folders. Searching across all folders can cause high server
      and database load because first all visible folders must be determined and if a user has object read permissions in that folders. Software
      internal default is true to prevent high load if the property is not defined. Default here is false because it is easier for the user to
      find contacts.

      "The auto complete search for email addresses may be triggered easily and quite often if a new email is written and a part of a recipients
      address is written. This can lead to high load on the database system if a context has a lot of users and a lot of contacts. Therefore the
      scope if this search can be configured. Set this parameter to true and the auto complete search looks in every readable contact folder for
      contacts with emails addresses matching the already typed letters. If this parameter is configured to false, only three folders are
      considered for the search: the users private default contact folder, his contact folder for collected contacts and the global address book

      table automatically (covering fields specified through "com.openexchange.contact.fulltextIndexFields" property),
      and is used afterwards to serve the "find as you type" 
      auto-completion requests in an efficient way.
      Note that this index requires support for FULLTEXT index types on the used
      InnoDB table, which is available starting with MySQL 5.6.4 (see
      http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/fulltext-restrictions.html for
