# Controls which collections are exposed via the CardDAV interface. Possible 
# values are '0', '1' and '2'. A value of '1' makes each visible folder 
# available as a resource collection, while '2' only exposes an aggregated 
# collection containing  all contact resources from all visible folders. The 
# default value '0' exposes either an aggregated collection or individual 
# collections for each folder, depending on the client's user-agent (if the 
# user-agent indicates the Mac OS Addressbook client, the aggregated 
# collection is used, otherwise the individual ones).
