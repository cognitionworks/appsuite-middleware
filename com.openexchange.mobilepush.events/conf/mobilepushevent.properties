com.openxchange.mobilepush.events.gcm.enabled=false

# Specifies the API key of the server application. Required if
# "com.openxchange.mobilenotifier.events.gcm.enabled" is "true".
com.openxchange.mobilepush.events.gcm.key=

# Enables or disables push event notifications to clients using the Apple Push
# Notification service (APNS) for iOS devices. This requires a valid

# Defaults to "false".
com.openxchange.mobilepush.events.apn.ios.enabled=false

# Specifies the path to the local keystore file (PKCS #12) containing the APNS
# certificate and keys for the iOS application, e.g.
# "/opt/open-xchange/etc/mobilepush-apns.p12". Required if
# "com.openxchange.mobilepush.events.apn.ios.enabled" is "true".
com.openxchange.mobilepush.events.apn.ios.keystore=

# Specifies the password used when creating the referenced keystore containing
# the certificate of the iOS application. Note that blank or null passwords
# are in violation of the PKCS #12 specifications. Required if
# "com.openxchange.mobilepush.events.apn.ios.enabled" is "true".
com.openxchange.mobilepush.events.apn.ios.password=

# Indicates which APNS service is used when sending push notifications to iOS
# devices. A value of "true" will use the production service, a value of
# "false" the sandbox service. Defaults to "true".
com.openxchange.mobilepush.events.apn.ios.production=true

# Configures the interval between queries to the APN feedback service for the
# subscribed iOS devices. The value can be defined using units of
# measurement: "D" (=days), "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours). Defaults to "1D"
# (one day). Leaving this parameter empty disables the feedback queries on
# this node. Since each received feedback is processed cluster-wide, only one
# node in the cluster should be enabled here. Values less than 1m will be ignored.
