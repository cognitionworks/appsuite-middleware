# For example the folder tree could look like this:
# [path]
#	-generic
#		-generic.branding
#		-OX Drive_vX.Y.Z.exe
#		-OX Drive_vX.Y.Z.msi
#	-yourOwnBranding

# The filename of the drive updater template
# Default: 'oxdrive_update.tmpl'
com.openexchange.drive.updater.tmpl=oxdrive_update.tmpl

# The name of the system wide drive branding identifier
# This name must be equal to the name of one of the subfolder's under com.openexchange.drive.updater.path
# This property can be overwritten through the config-cascade mechanism. 
# Therefore you can configure different branding's for different context-sets or even single users.
