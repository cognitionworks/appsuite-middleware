# when to fire push events?
# possible values: newmail,always
# default: always
# Explanation:
# newmail means to only send a push event in case of at least one
#         new mail has arrived. NOTE: Using dovecot this does only
#         work when only ONE concurrent session of the same user
#         is active.
# always  send a push event for every changes to the users mailbox.
com.openexchange.push.imapidle.pushmode=always

# since commons logging is hard to configure, do it our own using LOG.info when debug is on here
com.openexchange.push.imapidle.debug=true
