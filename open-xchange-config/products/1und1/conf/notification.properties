# Settings in this file (among others) govern, when notification eMails are sent once a task of appointment is modified.
# Whether notification mails are sent is goverened a) by a user specific setting in the configuration b) by
# the checkbox when creating a task/appointment c) by settings in this file. 

# a) The user specific setting
# Each user can specify whether he wants to receive notification emails for tasks or appointments. The user can
# set this individually per object type. If the user chooses not to be notified for (say) tasks, that's the end of 
# the story, the notification mails won't ever bother her (for tasks). She may choose separately that she's interested
# about appointment notifications, and enable the corresponding feature. This would mean she might be notified of changes
# to appointments in which she is a participant. This is goverened by the other settings. 

# b) The checkbox when creating/modifying a task/appointment
# Notice in the dialog when creating or editing an appointment there is a checkbox labeled 'Notify Participants'.
# If this checkbox is enabled, the participants of the task/appointment will be notified of the change (unless their
# user specific setting as per a) suppress that). Also the person creating or changing the object will not get the 
# notification mail, because, presumably, she knows what she has been doing. Also the owner is always notified
# of a change to a task/appointment by someone else other than the owner (unless the notification is suppressed as per a) ).

# c) Settings in this file
# Sometimes an action doesn't allow you to check the checkbox under b) but it might still be a good idea to notify
# participants of an action. For example, when deleting an appointment this is usually of great interest to many people.
# So the setting 'notify_participants_on_delete' in this file supersedes the checkbox setting. If set to 'true' all 
# participants will be notified when the appointment or task is deleted with the exception of the person deleting
# the appointment/task.


notify_participants_on_delete = true

# Direct links for notifications are generated according to the following pattern.
# [hostname] is replaced with the hostname of your machine, [module], [object] and [folder]
# are replaced with the relevant IDs to generate the direct link.
