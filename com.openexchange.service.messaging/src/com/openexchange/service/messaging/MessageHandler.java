/**
 * {@link MessageHandler} - The listener for {@link Message messages}.
 * <p>
 * {@link MessageHandler} objects are registered with the messaging service registry and are notified with a {@link Message} object when a
 * message is sent or posted.
 * <p>
 * <code>MessageHandler</code> objects can inspect the received <code>Message</code> object to determine its topic and properties.
 * <p>
 * <code>MessageHandler</code> objects must be registered with a service property {@link MessagingServiceConstants#MESSAGE_TOPIC} whose
 * value is the list of topics in which the message handler is interested.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * String[] topics = new String[] { &quot;com/isv/*&quot; };
 * Hashtable ht = new Hashtable();
 * ht.put(MessagingServiceConstants.MESSAGE_TOPIC, topics);
 * context.registerService(MessageHandler.class.getName(), this, ht);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Event Handler services can also be registered with an {@link MessagingServiceConstants#MESSAGE_FILTER} service property to further filter
 * the events. If the syntax of this filter is invalid, then the Event Handler must be ignored by the messaging service. The messaging
 * service should log a warning.
