# Specifies the number of buffered schemas per registered database.
#
# A value of less than/equal to 0 (zero) means no buffered schemas, which implicitly enabled strict schema management:
# - acquired a lock when creating/deleting a context
# - create schemas on demand
# - immediately drop empty schemas
#
# A value of greater than 0 (zero) ensures that a database always holds the specified number of vacant schemas, avoiding the
# need to acquire a lock and allows a more lenient schema management.
# The resulting concurrency level is the product of <CONTEXTS_PER_SCHEMA>  multiplied by <NUM_BUFFERED_SCHEMAS>.
# Therefore ensure that CONTEXTS_PER_SCHEMA is configured according to expected number of concurrent context creation/deletions.

# Default: 0
