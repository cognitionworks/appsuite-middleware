Description: Module implementing the default authorization
 This package installs the OSGi bundle publishing the OSGi AuthorizationService. This bundle implements the default authorization method
 for the backend. When a user got authenticated a second step is to verify that he is authorized to use Open-Xchange currently. The default
 implementation checks wether the context of the user is enabled.
