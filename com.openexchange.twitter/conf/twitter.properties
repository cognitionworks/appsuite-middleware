# These keys MAY need to be replaced by ones coming from an application managed at https://dev.twitter.com/apps (twitter-account required)
# This depends on whether you want your own company-name to be shown during the authentication process 
# Please try the process of subscribing to twitter in the User interface with the supplied keys first
# If you want your own application only a few things need to be considered:
# "Application Type" needs to be "Browser" in the Twitter-App.
# What you enter in "Registered Callback Url" does not matter as OX sends an overriding callback-url, reflecting its hostname, anyway.
