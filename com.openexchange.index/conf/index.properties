# Specify all modules that may be indexed as a 
# comma-separated list of module identifiers (these are numbers defined in 
# http://oxpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=HTTP_API#LinkObject).
# The default value is empty and disables indexing as a whole.
#
# This value takes effect on server granularity and 
# can be overwritten for sets of contexts, single contexts and single users.
# See http://oxpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=ConfigCascade and /ox-config-path/contextSets/index.yml
# for more information on this.
#
# Possible modules:
# E-Mail:       19
#
# As of now only E-Mail can be enabled. 
# Enabling other modules may lead to unforseen errors during runtime.
