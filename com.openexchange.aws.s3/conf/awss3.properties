# Configuration file for S3 file storages


# This file provides the configuration of all file storages based on the
# Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Each connected storage is 
# identified by a so called "filestore ID", which refers to the authority 
# part of the URI configured in the "uri" column in the "filestore" table of
# the config database.

# For each configured filestore, an own set of the available properties may 
# be defined, replacing [filestoreID] with the actual identifier.

# For example, the following lines configure a Ceph-based S3 storage at 
# "http://radosgw.example.com", referenced by the URI "s3://radosgw" in the
# configuration database:
#
# com.openexchange.aws.s3.radosgw.endpoint=http://radosgw.example.com
# com.openexchange.aws.s3.radosgw.region=eu-west-1
# com.openexchange.aws.s3.radosgw.accessKey=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
# com.openexchange.aws.s3.radosgw.secretKey=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY


# == Template ================================================================

# Specifies the endpoint (e.g. "ec2.amazonaws.com") or a full URL, including 
# the protocol (e.g. "https://ec2.amazonaws.com") of the region specific AWS 
# endpoint this client will communicate with. Defaults to "s3.amazonaws.com" 
# if not defined.
com.openexchange.aws.s3.[filestoreID].endpoint=

# Configures the Amazon S3 region to use when creating new buckets. This value
# is also used to pre-configure the client when no specific endpoint is set.
# Possible values are "us-gov-west-1", "us-east-1", "us-west-1", "us-west-2", 
# "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-1", "ap-southeast-2", "ap-northeast-1" and 
# "sa-east-1". Defaults to "us-west-2"
com.openexchange.aws.s3.[filestoreID].region=us-west-2

# Configures the AWS access key to use. Required. 
com.openexchange.aws.s3.[filestoreID].accessKey=

# Configures the AWS secret key to use. Required.
