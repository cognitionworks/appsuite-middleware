      Key: com.openexchange.pns.transport.apn.ios.enabled
      Description: >
Specifies whether the APNS transport is enabled. That property is responsive to config-cascade
and reloadable as well.

Moreover, an even finer-grained decision is possible to be configured as a certain transport
is checked for availability providing user, context, client and topic.
Hence, it is possible to  specify:

com.openexchange.pns.transport.apn.ios.enabled + ("." + {client})? + ("." + {topic})?

com.openexchange.pns.transport.apn.ios.enabled.open-xchange-appsuite.ox:calendar:new=false

That allows the client "open-xchange-appsuite" (App Suite UI) to receive "new mail" notifications
via APNS, but not for "new appointment".

Default false
