Appsuite version 7.10.2 provides methods for users to require secondary, additional methods of authentication before creating a valid Appsuite session.  These methods may include SMS messages, Time based authenticator methods, U2F compatible devices/keyfobs, and other custom methods.

## Enabling Multifactor

The `open-xchange-multifactor` package is required for the core of multifactor authentication. For some methods (such as SMS), additional packages will be required.

With SMS, for example, you must also install a provider, such as `open-xchange-sms-sipgate`.

Then, multifactor must be enabled as a capability.  This can be done in the multifactor.properties file, or as a cascade value

```properties
com.openexchange.capability.multifactor=true
```



## Enabling SMS

First, the SMS provider must be installed and configured.  Most will require a configured username and password, or AUTH_TOKEN.  Install the needed package and configure.

At that point, you should enable SMS in the multifactor.properties file

```properties
 com.openexchange.multifactor.sms.enabled=true
```

The following properties are also available

```properties
com.openexchange.multifactor.sms.tokenLength   (default is 8 characters)
com.openexchange.multifactor.sms.tokenLifetime (Number of minutes until challenge expires)
com.openexchange.multifactor.maxTokenAmount (Maximum number of challenges before locked out)
```

## Enabling TOTP

TOTP is Time-based One Time Password.  This works with several apps available in mobile stores, such as Google Authenticator.

To enable, just set in the multifactor.properties file

```properties
com.openexchange.multifactor.totp.enabled=true
```

## Enabling Backup String

This is a method to allow a user to log into their account if they lose their primary multifactor authentication device (say losing their phone or U2F token).  It is a long string that they can copy, download, or print to use to unlock the account in the event of loss

To enable, set in the multifactor.properties file

```properties
com.openexchange.multifactor.backupString.enabled=true
```



## Enabling U2F

U2F is supported in Google Chrome, as well as Firefox (though requires user changing advanced settings).

In multifactor.properties, enable U2F

```properties
com.openexchange.multifactor.u2f.enabled=true
```

Then, the domain that the user will be using must be specified.  This will be used with the requests to the U2F device, and must mach the website.  This configuration is config-cascade aware

```properties
 com.openexchange.multifactor.u2f.appId=https://yourdomain
```



## Login Page

By default, the UI will change from the login page, draw the customized toolbar, then display a prompt for the multifactor authentication.

If you would prefer to have your login screen, or a different second factor screen used as the background, then you can configure in the as-config.yml

For example:

```yaml
 default:
     host: all
     signinTheme: default
     multifactorBackground: pages/secondFactor
```
