title: Push Notification Service
---

# Introduction

Starting with v7.8.3 the Open-Xchange Middleware implemented a generic Push Notification Service that supports delivering arbitrary
user-associated push notification messages to multiple clients in a transport-agnostic way.


# How it works

Several event-trapping locations inside the Open-Xchange Middleware are allowed to pass messages consisting of a topic name and arbitrary
associated properties to the OSGi singleton service `com.openexchange.pns.PushNotificationService`. For instance, the listeners for new
incoming mails pass a message with topic `"ox:mail:new"` along-side with (at least) associated mail folder.

Then that service looks-up every existing explicit or implicit subscriptions for every client that signals interest for notification's topic.
A subscription provides for a certain user/client pair:

 - The topics of interest; one/multiple identifiers or using a wild-card notation; e.g. `"ox:mail:*"`
 - The transport to use
 - The token to use (if any)

The payload is created according to client-associated message generator and finally sent out using the subscriptions' channels (be it APNS,
GCM or Web Sockets) to the client end-points.

Hence, in order to let a certain client for a user receive notifications for a topic, an explicit or implicit subscription needs to exist
that advertises interest for notification's topic. That subscription specifies the identifier of the transport as well as the to use.
In addition, a dedicated implementation of `com.openexchange.pns.PushMessageGenerator` needs to be OSGi-wise registered, which is responsible
for yielding the appropriate message that is transported using specified transport channel to that certain client.

# Explicit subscription

An explicit subscription is created by invoking `com.openexchange.pns.PushSubscriptionRegistry.registerSubscription()`. The subscription is
permanently stored to database and associated tables are queried on incoming notifications. This is the suitable way for mobile clients that
are supposed to receive push notifications using a cloud push service using the `/ajax/pns?action=subscribe` HTTP request.

# Implicit subscription

An implicit subscription can be advertised through implementing and OSGi-wise registering an instance of `com.openexchange.pns.PushSubscriptionProvider`.
For instance, due to the volatile nature of Web Sockets, there is no permanent subscription (and unsubscription), but an instance of
`com.openexchange.pns.PushSubscriptionProvider` that simply checks if there is any open Web Socket for notification-associated user and
signals that there is an interested subscription (provided that notification's topic fits into Web Socket processable messages)
