# Possible tests

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| address | This test type applies to addresses only. So it may be used for all header fields which contain addresses. This test returns true if any combination of the header-list and values-list arguments match. |
| envelope | This test applies to the envelope of a mail. This test isn't used under normal circumstances as the envelope isn't accessible in all mail setups. This test returns true if any combination of the header-list and values-list arguments match. |
| true | A test for a true result (can be used if an action command should be executed every time). |
| not | Negates a given test. |
| size | Deals with the size of the mail. |
| currentdate | Compares a given date with the current date (available since v6.20) |
| header | Tests against all headers of a mail. So with this test in contrast to the address test also fields such as subject can be handled. This test returns true if any combination of the header-list and values-list arguments match. |
| body | Tests against the content of a mail. |
| allof | Defines an AND condition between several tests. |
| anyof | Defines an OR condition between several tests. |

# Possible comparisons

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| is | If a field is equal to a given value. |
| contains | If a field contains a given value at any position. |
| matches | Tests if the value matches the value in the specified field ("*" matches zero or more characters, "?" matches a single character, to use these characters themselves they have to be escaped via backslash). | 
| regex | Tests if a given regular expression matches with the value present in the specified field. |
| user | Tests if the user part of an e-mail address is the value given here. This means in herbert+mustermann@example.com. The user checks the part herbert (only possible in conjunction with the `address` test). | 
| detail | Tests if the detail part of an e-mail address is the value given here. In the example above this evaluates to mustermann (only possible in conjunction with the `address` test). |

## Possible size comparisons

| Name | Description |

| under | Used in the size test to check for a value less than the given one. |

# Possible extensions
