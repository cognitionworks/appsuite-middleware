title: Http proxy support
---

Depending on the network infrastructure, it may be the case that middleware nodes do not have direct access to the internet.
In those cases access is only possible via a http proxy. With 7.10.0 it will be possible to configure such a http proxy via
well known java system properties:

* http.proxyHost
* http.proxyPort
* http.proxyUser
* http.proxyPassword
* http.nonProxyHosts
* https.proxyHost
* https.proxyPort
* https.proxyUser
* https.proxyPassword

For example this can be achieved by adding the properties to the ox-scriptconf.sh script:

```
[...]
JAVA_OPTS_OTHER=" -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.my.domain -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.my.domain -Dhttp.proxyPort=proxyPort -Dhttps.proxyPort=proxyPort"
[...]
```

It is recommended to whitelist internal systems by adding them to the `http.nonProxyHosts` property. E.g.:

```
-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=localhost|127.*|[::1]|my.internal.system
```
