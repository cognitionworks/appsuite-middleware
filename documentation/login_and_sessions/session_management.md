# Introduction
With v7.10.0 the Open-Xchange middleware offers the user the possibility to check what other sessions are already active based on his credentials.
Information shown per session consists of IP address, time of login, client and user-agent associated to this session. In case the IP-based [geolocation service]({{site.baseurl}}/middleware/miscellaneous/geolocation_deployment_guide.html) is active the location of the ip address is also shown. Additionally the user is able to terminate any of his sessions, e.g. if a device has been stolen.

# Installation
This feature is included in ``open-xchange-core`` package. Thus, no additional packages need to be installed.

# Configuration

## Global lookup
By default, all existing user sessions in the (hazelcast) cluster are shown. This can be disabled by setting ```com.openexchange.session.management.globalLookup``` to ```false```.
Deactivating global lookup is recommended for setups with only one middleware node or setups without installed ```open-xchange-sessionstorage-hazelcast``` package.

## Client blacklist
It's possible to blacklist client-identifiers, those sessions are not displayed for the user. This is recommended for clients that open user sessions for maintenance reasons. By default, the blacklist is empty.
To blacklist clients, their client-identifiers have to be added to ```com.openexchange.session.management.clientBlacklist``` as a comma-separated list.

## Use of geolocation service (optional)
With an active geolocation service, in the sessions overview the user gets information about the location, based on the IP address assigned to that session.
To enable geolocation service, the package ```open-xchange-geoip``` has to be installed. This package uses the geolocation service provided by MaxMind Inc. (www.maxmind.com), no further
configuration of this service is needed.

# Examples

## Blacklisting clients
Example configuration to blacklist OX Mailapp and clients connected via Exchange ActiveSync:
```properties
com.openexchange.session.management.blacklist=open-xchange-mobile-api-facade,open-xchange-mailapp,USM-EAS
```
