# Configuration file for USM
#
# Unless otherwise specified, the given values also represent the default values for the properties

# ---------------------
# Global USM properties
# ---------------------

# Specifies the module to check in the ajax configuration to test if USM is enabled.
# If not set (or set to an empty string), the new (and final) method is used by checking
# "modules/com.openexchange.usm/module", otherwise "modules/interface/<config-value" is checked 
# Default: (not set)
com.openexchange.usm.access_check_module=

# Determines the limit for inactivity of an USM session after which the persistent session data is removed
# (i.e. slow sync is required afterwards). This value is specified in days, the default value is 60 (approx. 2 months).
# For sessions that haven't been access using the new system which stores the accurate information in a
# persistent field, double that value is used and the newest sync key is used to determine an approximation
# of the last access.
# Default: 60
com.openexchange.usm.session_storage_time_limit=60

# Specifies a timeout (in seconds) after which USM sessions that are not accessed will be removed from memory. Removed sessions
# will be automatically restored from DB on next access, but since server changes couldn't be traced while the session was not in
# memory, the client has to perform an (incremental) sync for each folder (it will be notified that each folder changed regardless of
# any real server changes).
# Default: 43200 (12h)
com.openexchange.usm.cache.session.timeout=43200

# Specifies a timeout (in seconds) after which cached SyncStates that are not accessed will be removed from memory. Removed SyncStates
# will be automatically restored from DB on next access.
# Default: 3600 (1h)
com.openexchange.usm.cache.syncstate.timeout=3600

# Specifies the time interval (in milliseconds) for the periodical task USMSessionCacheCleanup,
# which removes unused SyncStates from the memory cache.
# Default: 60000 (1 min.)
com.openexchange.usm.session_cache_check_interval=60000

# Specifies the time interval (in milliseconds) for the periodical logging information about the
# number of USM sessions and SyncStates removed from the memory cache.
# Default: 300000 (5 min.)
com.openexchange.usm.session_cache_check_interval_log_info=300000

# ---------------------------------------------------
# Properties to configure the access to the OX server
# ---------------------------------------------------

# Defines the base URL that is used to access the OX server interface
# Default: http://localhost/ajax/
com.openexchange.usm.ox.url=http://localhost/ajax/

# Specifies the overall maximum number of (concurrent) connections the USM may use for requests to the OX server.
# Default: 100
com.openexchange.usm.ox.max_connections=100

# Specifies the time (in milliseconds) after which idle connections to the OX server will be closed.
# Default: 60000 (1 min.)
com.openexchange.usm.ox.idle_connection_timeout=60000

# Specifies if the HttpClient should perform stale checking of Connections before using them (increases security, lowers performance).
# Default: true
com.openexchange.usm.ox.perform_stale_checking=true

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Properties to modify behavior of the USM sync system
# ----------------------------------------------------

# Defines the maximum number of sync retries if a sync fails due to a concurrent modification on the OX server while the sync is in progress
# Default: 3
com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.concurrent_modification_retries=3

# Defines the delay that is used when waiting for changes in email folders (Session.waitForChanges()) after which
# a pull on email folders is performed. The delay can either be specified as a fixed value in milliseconds which
# defines the maximum time to wait (if the waitForChanges waits for a smaller interval, the pull will be performed
# at the end of the wait) or as a percentage (integer ending with a "%"), which indicates a portion of the given
# wait interval after which the pull will be performed.
# Note that the effective delay will be modified by the com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.email_pull_min_delay
# property which may increase the delay or prohibit a pull completely.
# Default: 50%
com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.email_pull_delay=50%

# Defines the minimum delay that is required when waiting for changes in email folders (Session.waitForChanges())
# after which a pull on email folders will be performed. The value is specified in milliseconds. The effective
# delay will be the maximum of this property and the result of the computation based on the
# com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.email_pull_delay property and the value specified as parameter to the
# waitForChanges()-call. If the effective value is greater than the parameter to the waitForChanges()-call,
# no pull will be performed.
# To disable pulling completely, set the value of this property to a negative value.
# Default: 60000 (1 min.)
com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.email_pull_min_delay=60000

# Defines a limit on the number of sync states that are stored in the database and local memory cache
# for each folder and the folder hierarchy itself (per session/client). If a client connects to the USM
# with a given sync state, all older states are automatically removed, the new state is computed, stored in
# the database and sent to the client. As long a client uses an old synckey, new keys keep getting generated,
# but none deleted. If the limit specified here is reached, the USM deletes the oldest sync state on a client
# connect. Based on the value of the property com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.keep_last_sent_state_in_db
# the USM either deletes the oldest sync state (false) or the oldest one that's not equal to the one the client
# just used to sync with (true).
# Note that the value of this property imposes an upper limit to the number of sync states stored in the cache
# and database. If a client behaves as expected, only 2 states will be stored (the one used by the client to
# initiate synchronization in case the synchronization result does not reach the client, and the new generated
# one that contains the base state for the next synchronization).
# The lower limit for this property is 2, since at least 2 sync states are required to account for possible
# communication failures.
# Default: 5
com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.max_states_in_db=5

# If this property is set to true, the USM ensures that the sync state corresponding to the last sync key that was
# used by a client stays in the cache and database. If set to false, the USM always deletes the oldest sync state
# if the limit of allowed sync states is reached for a folder.
# Default: true
com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.keep_last_sent_state_in_db=true

# As long as there is no immediate need to make sure the newest OX server data is compared to
# the client data/requests, the data from previous sync calls# will be cached and no OX call will be
# performed to determine its current data for the content of a folder (or for the folder hierarchy).
# The cached data will be invalidated if an OX event indicates that some change has occurred, and
# it won't be used if any client requests (creation/change/deletion) are received (the sync system has
# to make sure that the client requests are compred to the current data on the server). It will also be
# invalidated after some time, which can be configured for 2 different scenarios:
# - a complete sync, i.e. all pending server changes have been reported to the client
# - an incomplete sync, i.e. only some of the server changes have been reported to the client (in this case, the
#   client normally performs another sync call to retrieve the remaining changes until the sync is complete)
# For performance reasons, the cache is completely in-memory (and therefore server-local), cached data will
# be automatically removed if memory is running low.
# For each scenario the cache can be disabled by setting the timeout value to 0.

# Time in milliseconds for which cached data will be stored for a complete sync.
# Default: 60000 (1 minute)
com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.cache.time_limit.complete=60000

# Time in milliseconds for which cached data will be stored for an incomplete sync.
# Default: 1200000 (20 minutes)
com.openexchange.usm.session.sync.cache.time_limit.incomplete=1200000

# USM uses an optimization to reduce the number of SyncState-updates in the DB: If a synchronization resulted
# in no changes, no new SyncState will be stored and the original SyncKey will be reused. This option allows to
# disable the optimization, enforcing a new SyncState for each synchronization performed. This option is provided
# in case any clients show errors/problems with the changed behavior of the optimization (same SyncKey is being
# reused).
# Default: false
com.openexchange.usm.force_new_sync_key_on_empty_sync=false

# Defines a limit for the maximum number of objects in a folder when
# synchronizing via USM. If a folder contains more objects than
# specified in the limit, only the newest changed ones are synchronized.
# This limit is always additionally applied, regardless of the
# setting requested by the client, to allow server
# administrators to impose a hard limit on the synchronized
# objects. A value of <=0 is interpreted as no filtering.
# Default: 65535
com.openexchange.usm.max_objects_per_folder=65535

# Defines a limit for the maximum number of synchronized PIM attachments per object when synchronizing via USM.
# If 1 object has more PIM attachments than this limit, only the first attachments (sorted by OX ID) will be synchronized.
# A value < 0 disables the limit, all PIM attachments will be synchronized.
# Default: 100
com.openexchange.usm.max_attachment_count_per_object=100

# Defines a limit in bytes for the synchronized PIM attachments per object when synchronizing via USM.
# If the sum of the sizes of the attachments to an object exceeds this limit, only the first attachments
# (sorted by OX ID) will be synchronized.
# A value < 0 disables the limit, all PIM attachments will be synchronized.
# Default: 52428800 (50 MB)
com.openexchange.usm.max_attachment_size_per_object=52428800

#If this property is set to true, usm passes the client host header in the login request to the server in a custom X-Host header. 
com.openexchange.usm.pass_client_host_header=true

# Defines a timeout in milliseconds for how long temporary files created by protocols (e.g. uploaded by clients)
# will be stored after they have been last accessed. This overrides the setting of the OX ManagedFileManagement
# for temporary files generated by USM. To use the default setting of the OX ManagedFileManagement specify a
# value < 0.
# Default: 7200000 (2 hours)
com.openexchange.usm.temp_files.timeout=7200000
