# If the sum of all uploaded files in one request is greater than this value, the upload will be rejected.
# This value can be overridden on a per-user basis by setting the upload_quota in the mail configuration of this user
# If this value is not set or 0, the more general MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE configured in server.properties will be used. If that value
# is also 0 or not set, uploads will be unrestricted.
