# Number of nodes with synchronized backups. Synchronized backups block operations until backups are successfully copied and
# acknowledgements are received. If 1 is set as the backup-count for example, then all entries of the map will be copied to
# another JVM for fail-safety. 0 means no backup. Any integer between 0 and 6. Default is 1, setting bigger than 6 has no effect.

# Number of nodes with async backups. Async backups do not block operations and do not require acknowledgements. 0 means no backup.

# Maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the map. Entries that are older than <time-to-live-seconds>

# While recovering from split-brain (network partitioning), map entries	in the small cluster will merge into the
# bigger cluster based on the policy set here. When an entry merge into the cluster, there might an existing entry 
# with the same key already. Values of these entries might be different for	that same key. Which value should be
# set for the key? Conflict is resolved	by the policy set here. Default policy is hz.ADD_NEW_ENTRY. There are built-in 
# merge policies such as
# hz.NO_MERGE ; no entry will merge.
# hz.ADD_NEW_ENTRY ; entry will be added if the merging entry's key doesn't exist in the cluster. 
# hz.HIGHER_HITS ; entry with the higher hits wins.
# hz.LATEST_UPDATE ; entry with the latest update wins.
