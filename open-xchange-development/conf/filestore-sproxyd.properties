# Configuration file for sproxyd file storages


# This file provides the configuration of all file storages based on the
# Scality sproxyd API. Each connected storage is identified by a so called 
# "filestore ID", which refers to the authority part of the URI configured 
# in the "uri" column in the "filestore" table of the config database, 
# previously registered using "./registerfilestore -t [filestoreID]".
# For each configured filestore, an own set of the properties may be defined, 
# replacing [filestoreID] with the actual identifier. Refer to the following 
# template for available configuration options, or further down for a simple 
# example.


# == Template ================================================================

# Specifies the base URL to the sproxyd connector, including the protocol, 
# port and path, this client will communicate with, e.g.
# "http://sproxyd.example.com:81/proxy/ox/". Required.
