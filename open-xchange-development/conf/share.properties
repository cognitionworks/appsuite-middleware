# Defines the timespan after which an unused named guest user should be 
# removed from the system. "Unused" time starts after the last share to the 
# guest user has been revoked. This setting only affects "named" guest users,
# i.e. users that were invited explicitly and authenticate using their 
# e-mail-address.
# The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days), 
# "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours). Defaults to "2W" (two weeks), with a minimum 
# of "1D" (one day). A value of "0" disables the delayed guest user deletion, 
# so that guest users are deleted right after the last share to them was 
# removed.  
com.openexchange.share.cleanup.guestExpiry=2W

# Defines the interval of a periodic background task that performs 
# sharing-related cleanup operations like removal of expired shares or final
# deletion of no longer used guest users. The task is executed only once per 
# interval in the cluster, so this value should be equally defined on each
# node.
# The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days), 
# "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours). Defaults to "1D" (one day), with a minimum 
# of "1H" (one hour). A value of "0" disables the periodic background task.
com.openexchange.share.cleanup.periodicCleanerInterval=1D

# Specifies the quota for the number of shares that are allowed being created 
# by one user.
# A value <= 0 means unlimited.
# This value can be overwritten by setting specific values for context sets.
# Default is 150
com.openexchange.quota.share=150

# Mapping from arbitrary module names to module identifiers and vice versa.
# The value must be a comma-separated list of module names and its identifier linked with an equals sign.
# Example: example_module_name=13,another_module=20.
# Default is no value
com.openexchange.share.modulemapping=

# Defines a key that is used to encrypt the password/pin of anonymously 
# accessible shares in the database.  
# Defaults to "erE2e8OhAo71", and should be changed before the creation of the
# first share on the system.

# Defines up to which time in the future appointments and tasks are included 
# when accessing an iCal-serializable share with a client requesting the 
# "text/calendar" representation of the resource.
# Possible values are "one_month", "six_months", "one_year" and "two_years",
# the default interval is "one_year".
com.openexchange.share.handler.iCal.futureInterval=one_year

# Defines up to which time in the past appointments and tasks are included 
# when accessing an iCal-serializable share with a client requesting the 
# "text/calendar" representation of the resource.
# Possible values are "two_weeks", "one_month", "six_months" and "one_year",
# the default interval is "two_weeks".
com.openexchange.share.handler.iCal.pastInterval=two_weeks

# Specifies the location to redirect to when accessing a share link that 
# requires authentication. This is usually the default login page that will 
# then perform the "anonymous" or "guest" login action.
#
# [uiwebpath] is replaced with the value of "com.openexchange.UIWebPath" as 
# defined in "server.properties", trimmed by leading and trailing '/' 
# characters. Defaults to "/[uiwebpath]/ui".
com.openexchange.share.loginLink=/[uiwebpath]/ui
