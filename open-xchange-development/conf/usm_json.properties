# Configuration file for USM-JSON-API
#
# Unless otherwise specified, the given values also represent the default values for the properties

# Defines the webserver path under which the JSON servlet registers itself.
# Default: /usm-json
com.openexchange.usm.json.alias=/usm-json

# Defines minimum wait delay in milliseconds (until next ping should be requested) sent from the server.
# Default: 5000
com.openexchange.usm.json.ping.min_interval=5000

# Defines maximum wait delay in milliseconds (until next ping should be requested) sent from the server.
# Default: 360000
com.openexchange.usm.json.ping.max_interval=360000

# Defines the average number of ping requests that should not be exceeded, The server will
# increse the returned delay from min upto max to stay within this limit at average
# Default: 100
com.openexchange.usm.json.ping.max_requests_per_second=100

# Defines a hard limit on syncInit and syncUpdate that will never be exceeded by server replies regardless of client parameters.
# The limit will be respected even if the client sent no limit. A value of <=0 means no hard limit.
# Default: 0
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.limit.objects=0

# Defines a limit in bytes of accumulated email sizes that may be transmitted from the server to client in 1 syncInit/syncUpdate call
# This limit is in addition to the object count limit and any optional limit provided by clients. Only whole emails are synced and at least
# 1 email will be transmitted (unless the client specified a limit of 0 objects to transmit).
# Default: 2097152 (2 MB)
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.limit.email_size=2097152

# Defines a limit regarding the number of attachments that will be transmitted in 1 syncInit/syncUpdate. Note that for this
# limit only main objects of appointment series are counted (exceptions to a series will be always transmitted). At least 1
# PIM object will be reported even if this contains more attachments than specified in the limit.
# Default: 5
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.limit.pim_attachment_count=5

# If this property is true, unknown UUIDs sent from clients for changes/deletions will cause the sync to abort (with WRONG_MISSING_PARAMETERS),
# if it is false, the sync will continue and and error will be reported for the object(s) that wasn't found.
# Default: false
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.fatal_uuid_errors=false

# Defines the lower time filter limit in days.
# Appointments and mails which are in the past beyond this limit will not be synchronised from/to the client.
# Setting the limit to a value <= 0 disables the filter, all old objects will be synchronized
# Default: 365 (1 year)
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.timefilter_limit_past=365

# Defines the upper time filter limit in days.
# Appointments and mails which are in the future beyond this limit will not be synchronised from/to the client.
# Setting the limit to a value <= 0 disables the filter, all objects in the future will be synchronized
# Default: 730 (2 years)

# Defines the interval (in milliseconds) after which usm should poll the inbox if no changes were reported by OX events.
# Default: 600000 (10 min.)
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.inbox_polling_interval=600000

# Defines a check interval in milliseconds that is used to prevent clients with bad behavior to cause too much load
# on the server. If it is set to a value > 0 (and com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.max_accesses and
# com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.refusal_interval are also set > 0), it specifies an time interval which
# USM checks for unnecessary synchronizations. If within this interval the limit provided in max_accesses is reached,
# all further access from that client is refused for refusal_interval seconds (all requests report a temporary error).
# After the refusal_interval has passed, the check mechanism is reset (regardless of the number of client requests
# that were refused).
# Default: 0 (deactivated)
com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.test_interval=0

# Defines a limit for unnecessary synchronizations a client may perform within the test interval to prevent clients with
# bad behavior to cause too much load  on the server. If it is set to a value > 0 (and
# com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.test_interval and com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.refusal_interval
# are also set > 0), it specifies an time interval which USM checks for unnecessary synchronizations. If within this
# interval the limit provided in max_accesses is reached, all further access from that client is refused for refusal_interval
# seconds (all requests report a temporary error).
# After the refusal_interval has passed, the check mechanism is reset (regardless of the number of client requests
# that were refused).
# Default: 0 (deactivated)
com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.max_accesses=0

# Defines for how long a client is refused access to USM if it shows bad behavior to prohibit it to cause too much load
# on the server. If it is set to a value > 0 (and com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.test_interval and
# com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.refusal_interval are also set > 0), it specifies an time interval which

com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.refusal_interval=0

# Limit on the individual size of synchronized emails. Any emails that exceed that size will not be synchronized from
# the server to the client, and the client will get notified that such emails exist. A value < 0 deactivates the filter.
# Default: 52428800 (50 MB)
com.openexchange.usm.json.max_email_size=52428800

# Max. size of attachments that will be sent inline in sync-requests (only for clients that support API 2.0 and newer).
# Attachments below this size will be sent to the client with the sync response (as in older versions). Larger
# Attachments won't be sent directly, but can be requested by the client using an extra call.
# Default: 1048576 (1 MB)
