# Configuration file for USM-JSON-API

# Unless otherwise specified, the given values also represent the default values for the properties

# Defines the webserver path under which the JSON servlet registers itself. (default: /usm-json)
com.openexchange.usm.json.alias=/usm-json

# Defines minimum wait delay in ms. until next ping that is returned by server (default: 5000)
com.openexchange.usm.json.ping.min_interval=5000

# Defines the maximum wait delay in ms. until next ping that is returned by server (default: 360000)

# Defines the no. of ping requests that should not be exceeded, the server will increse the returned delay from min upto max to stay within this limit at average
com.openexchange.usm.json.ping.max_requests_per_second=1000

# Defines a hard limit on syncInit and syncUpdate that will never be exceeded by server replies regardless of client parameters.
# The limit will be respected even if the client sent no limit. A value of <=0 means no hard limit (default: 0)
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.limit.objects=0

# Defines a limit in bytes of accumulated email sizes that may be transmitted from the server to client in 1 syncInit/syncUpdate call
# This limit is in addition to the object count limit and any optional limit provided by clients. Only whole emails are synced and at least
# 1 email will be transmitted (unless the client specified a limit of 0 objects to transmit), default is 2 MByte.
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.limit.email_size=2097152

# Defines a limit regarding the number of attachments that will be transmitted in 1 syncInit/syncUpdate. Note that for this
# limit only main objects of appointment series are counted (exceptions to a series will be always transmitted). At least 1
# PIM object will be reported even if this contains more attachments than specified in the limit, default value is 5 attachments
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.limit.pim_attachment_count=5

# If this property is true, unknown UUIDs sent from clients for changes/deletions will cause the sync to abort (with WRONG_MISSING_PARAMETERS),
# if it is false, the sync will continue and and error will be reported for the object(s) that wasn't found.
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.fatal_uuid_errors=false

# Defines the lower time filter limit in days.
# Appointments and mails which are in the past beyond this limit will not be synchronised from/to the client.
# Setting the limit to a value <= 0 disables the filter, all old objects will be synchronized
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.timefilter_limit_past=365

# Defines the upper time filter limit in days.
# Appointments and mails which are in the future beyond this limit will not be synchronised from/to the client.
# Setting the limit to a value <= 0 disables the filter, all objects in the future will be synchronized

# Defines the interval after which usm should poll the inbox if no changes have arrived. 
com.openexchange.usm.json.sync.inbox_polling_interval=60000

# Defines a check interval in milliseconds that is used to prevent clients with bad behavior to cause too much load
# on the server. If it is set to a value > 0 (and com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.max_accesses and
# com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.refusal_interval are also set > 0), it specifies an time interval which
# USM checks for unnecessary synchronizations. If within this interval the limit provided in max_accesses is reached,
# all further access from that client is refused for refusal_interval seconds (all requests report a temporary error).
# After the refusal_interval has passed, the check mechanism is reset (regardless of the number of client requests
# that were refused). Default: 120000 (2 minutes)
com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.test_interval=0

# Defines a limit for unnecessary synchronizations a client may perform within the test interval to prevent clients with
# bad behavior to cause too much load  on the server. If it is set to a value > 0 (and
# com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.test_interval and com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.refusal_interval
# are also set > 0), it specifies an time interval which USM checks for unnecessary synchronizations. If within this
# interval the limit provided in max_accesses is reached, all further access from that client is refused for refusal_interval
# seconds (all requests report a temporary error).
# After the refusal_interval has passed, the check mechanism is reset (regardless of the number of client requests
# that were refused). Default: 40 (40 unnecessary requests)
com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.max_accesses=0

# Defines for how long a client is refused access to USM if it shows bad behavior to prohibit it to cause too much load
# on the server. If it is set to a value > 0 (and com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.test_interval and
# com.openexchange.usm.json.access_check.refusal_interval are also set > 0), it specifies an time interval which
# USM checks for unnecessary synchronizations. If within this interval the limit provided in max_accesses is reached,
