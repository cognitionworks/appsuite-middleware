# Configuration file for EAS

# Unless otherwise specified, the given values also represent the

#
# NOTE: For a complete production installation, you should at least set
# com.openexchange.usm.eas.uid_prefix (the last property in this file)
# to some unique value for your OX-cluster (or server in a single server
# installation).

# -----------------------------------------
# Properties to configure the EAS subsystem
# -----------------------------------------

# Specifies whether to check if a specific user is allowed to use EAS.
# This is done by checking the interfaces/eas-property in the OX ajax
# config for that user. The default value is true.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.access_check=true

# Defines the webserver path under which the EAS servlet registers itself.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.alias=/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync

# Defines the debug logfile that is generated by the EAS servlet.
# No logfile will be generated if the property is missing or set to
# an empty string.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.debug_log=

# Defines a pattern that is used to map a user login received from an
# EAS client to an OX login.
# This pattern will be used if the EAS client did not provide any domain.
# The text "$USER" in the pattern will be replaced by the user name
# provided by the EAS client.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.login_pattern.user_only=$USER

# Defines a pattern that is used to map a user login received from an
# EAS client to an OX login.
# This pattern will be used if the EAS client provided a domain and a
# user name.
# The text "$USER" in the pattern will be replaced by the user name
# provided by the EAS client.
# The text "$DOMAIN" in the pattern will be replaced by the user name
# provided by the EAS client.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.login_pattern.domain_user=$USER@$DOMAIN

# Defines a time limit in days to filter out old emails when syncing
# with EAS devices. This limit is always additionally applied,
# regardless of the setting requested by the EAS client, to allow
# server administrators to impose a hard limit on the synchronized
# mails (e.g. to reduce load on the mail servers if users tend to
# store all their mail in the INBOX). The default value of this
# property is 3 days, a value of 0 is interpreted as no filtering.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.mail.time_limit=3

# Defines a limit for the maximum number of emails in a folder when
# syncing with EAS devices. If a folder contains more emails than
# specified in the limit, only the newest ones are synchronized.
# This limit is always additionally applied, regardless of the
# setting requested by the EAS client, to allow server
# administrators to impose a hard limit on the synchronized
# mails (e.g. to reduce load on the mail servers if users tend to
# store all their mail in the INBOX). The default value of this
# property is 600 emails, a value of <=0 is interpreted as no
# filtering.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.mail.limit=600

# Defines how many folders may be watched with a single EAS ping
# request, defaults to unlimited (Integer.MAX_VALUE).
com.openexchange.usm.eas.ping.max_folders=10000

# Defines in seconds how long the minimum wait time specified by
# an EAS ping command may be. Note that the HTTP connection will
# be kept alive up to that time !
com.openexchange.usm.eas.ping.min_heartbeat=30

# Defines in seconds how long the maximum wait time specified by
# an EAS ping command may be. Note that the HTTP connection will
# be kept alive up to that time !
com.openexchange.usm.eas.ping.max_heartbeat=1800

# A unique random hex code must be specified to uniquely identify
# this OX server (cluster) to generate globally unique IDs for
# appointments.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.uid_prefix=0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f

# This property determines if the USM/EAS should send MeetingRequests
# for those emails that are invitations to appointments sent from the
# local OX server. Some devices (e.g. iPhone) perform automatic
# operations when receiving a MeetingRequest that collides with the
# fact that the OX server creates the appointment before the attendee
# has accepted it. If this property is disabled, the USM/EAS handles
# those invitation mails like normal mails. The default value for
# this property is true.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.meeting_request_enabled=true

# This property enables a special handling (for special devices, currently
# all non-Nokia) for all appointments to which the current user has been
# invited: The user won't see the appointment directly, instead a special
# invitation mail is generated. The original (optional) invitation mails from
# OX are ignored. The appointment will become visible after a
# MeetingResponse from the client or after the user status has been set
# in the OX server. This behavior is similar to that of MS products.
# If this property is set to false, the emulation is disabled, all appointments
# are reported directly, MeetingRequests are generated from the OX
# invitation mails. Caution: The behavior for the setting "false" may
# lead to problems in clients that expect the MS behavior, mostly to
# duplicate appointment entries.
com.openexchange.usm.eas.meeting_request_emulation_enabled=true

# If this property is set to true, in EAS by default all OX folders will be
# synchronized (experimental). If it is set to false (default), the original
# behavior will be used, i.e. only all default folders and their sub-folders
# will be synchronized. Note that this applies only to the default handling,
# via the OX Ajax configuration interface the root folders may be specified
# for each user individually (if implemented in the OX server).
com.openexchange.usm.eas.sync_all_folders=false
