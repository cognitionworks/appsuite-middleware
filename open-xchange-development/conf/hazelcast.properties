# (*) and ranges (-) can be used. Leave blank to listen on all interfaces
# Especially in server environments with multiple network interfaces, it's

# Configures the time until the first check if the cluster needs to merge is 
# scheduled. This takes a timespan parameter with 'ms' denoting milliseconds, 
# 's' denoting seconds, 'm' denoting minutes. The value is passed to the

# "120s"

# Configures the time between each check if the cluster needs to merge. This

# By default Hazelcast lets the system to pick up an ephemeral port during 
# socket bind operation. But security policies/firewalls may require to 
# restrict outbound ports to be used by Hazelcast enabled applications. To 
# fulfill this requirement, you can configure Hazelcast to use only defined 
# outbound ports. You can use port ranges and/or comma separated ports, e.g.
# "35000-35100" or "36001, 36002, 36003". Defaults to "".

# Enables or disables Hazelcast's internal Memcache client request listener

# Configures whether to bind the server- and client-sockets to any local
