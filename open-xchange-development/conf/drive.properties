# Properties for com.openexchange.drive

# Enables or disables the "drive" module capability globally.
com.openexchange.capability.drive=true

# Specifies whether the synchronization logic will make use of a folder named 
# ".drive" below the root synchronization folder or not. If enabled, this 
# folder is used to store temporary uploads and removed files, which usually
# leads to a better user experience since previously synchronized files can
# be restored from there for example. If not, removed files are not kept, and
# uploads are performed directly in the target folder.
# Defaults to "true".
com.openexchange.drive.useTempFolder=true

# Configures the interval between runs of the cleaner process for the 
# temporary ".drive" folder. A cleaner run is only initiated if the 
# synchronization is idle, i.e. the last synchronization resulted in no 
# actions to be performed, and the last run was before the configured 
# interval. The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days), 
# "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours). Defaults to "1D" (one day).
com.openexchange.drive.cleaner.interval=1D

# Defines the maximum age of files and directories to be kept inside the 
# temporary ".drive" folder. Files or directories that were last modified 
# before the configured age are deleted during the next run of the cleaner
# process. The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days), 
# "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours). Defaults to "1D" (one day).
com.openexchange.drive.cleaner.maxAge=1D

# Allows to limit the maximum used bandwidth for all downloads. If
# configured, downloads via the drive module handled by this backend node will
# not exceed the configured bandwidth. The available bandwidth is defined as 
# the number of allowed bytes per second, where the byte value can be 
# specified with one of the units "B" (bytes), "kB" (kilobyte), "MB" 
# (Megabyte) or "GB" (Gigabyte), e.g. "10 MB". Must fit into the "Integer" 
# range, i.e. the configured number of bytes has to be be smaller than 2^31. 
# Defaults to "-1" (no limitations).
com.openexchange.drive.maxBandwidth=-1

# Allows to limit the maximum used bandwidth for client downloads within the 
# same session. If configured, downloads originating in the same session via 
# the drive module handled by this backend node will not exceed the 
# configured bandwidth. The available bandwidth is defined as the number of 
# allowed bytes per second, where the byte value can be specified with one of 
# the units "B" (bytes), "kB" (kilobyte), "MB" (Megabyte) or "GB" (Gigabyte), 
# e.g. "500 kB". Must fit into the "Integer" range, i.e. the configured 
# number of bytes has to be be smaller than 2^31. Defaults to "-1" (no 
# limitations).
com.openexchange.drive.maxBandwidthPerClient=-1

# Specifies the maximum allowed number of synchronization operations, i.e. 
# all requests to the "drive" module apart from up- and downloads, that the 
# server accepts concurrently. While the limit is reached, further 
# synchronization requests are rejected in a HTTP 503 manner (service 
# unavailable), and the client is instructed to try again at a later time. 
# Defaults to "-1" (no limitations). 
com.openexchange.drive.maxConcurrentSyncOperations=-1

# Configures the pattern for a direct link to manage a user's quota. Text in 
# brackets is replaced dynamically during link generation in the backend, 
# however, it's still possible to overwrite them here with a static value, or 
# even define an arbitrary URL here. 
# [protocol] is replaced automatically with the protocol used by the client 
# (typically "http" or "https").
# [hostname] should be replaced with the server's canonical host name (if not,
# the server tries to determine the hostname on it's own), [uiwebpath] is 
# replaced with the value of "com.openexchange.UIWebPath" as defined in 
# "server.properties". [contextid], [userid] and [login] are replaced to 
# reflect the values of the current user. Defaults to "[protocol]://[hostname]".
com.openexchange.drive.directLinkQuota=[protocol]://[hostname]

# Enables or disables diagnostics logging for all drive synchronizations. 
# When enabled, a lot of additional debug information about all 
# synchronization processes is logged at "INFO" level. This setting affects 
# all users in all contexts and overrides any specific settings made in 
# "com.openexchange.drive.diagnosticsUsers". Defaults to "false".
# Note that this property may be changed at runtime, i.e. changes made to this
# property are applied (with a short delay) dynamically after the property 
# file is saved.
com.openexchange.drive.diagnostics=false

# Configures the diagnostics logging for specific users. When enabled, a lot 
# of additional debug information about the 
# synchronization process is logged at "INFO" level. The users for which the
# extended logging should be enabled are configured as comma separated values
# in the format "[user]@[context]", where [user] can be either the user name 
# or identifier, and [context] either the context name or identifier 
# respectively. For [user], it's also possible to use an asterisk ("*") as 
# wildcard, which would result in the diagnostics log being enabled for all 
# users in the context.    
# Note that this property may be changed at runtime, i.e. changes made to this
# property are applied (with a short delay) dynamically after the property 
# file is saved.
