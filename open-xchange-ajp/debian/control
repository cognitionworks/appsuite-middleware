Description: AJPv13 protocol based connector between backend and web server
 This package installs the OSGi bundle that implements an AJPv13 protocol based web server connector. The web server and the Open-Xchange
 backend are connected through this connector to provide the backend data to the web frontend or any other client through the HTTP or HTTPS
 protocol. Normally Apache is used as web server and it is possible to use mod_jk or mod_proxy_ajp to establish the connection.
 AJPv13 is optimized to use as few as possible connections to the backend by reusing AJPv13 connections for subsequent HTTP/HTTPS requests.
 This package and its bundle provide the OSGi http service internally for registering HTTP servlets and resources.
