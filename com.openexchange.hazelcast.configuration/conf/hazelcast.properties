# Configures the time until the first check if the cluster needs to merge is

# By default Hazelcast lets the system to pick up an ephemeral port during 
# socket bind operation. But security policies/firewalls may require to 
# restrict outbound ports to be used by Hazelcast enabled applications. To 
# fulfill this requirement, you can configure Hazelcast to use only defined 
# outbound ports. You can use port ranges and/or comma separated ports, e.g.
# "35000-35100" or "36001, 36002, 36003". Defaults to "".
