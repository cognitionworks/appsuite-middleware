              * `CREDENTIALS_REFRESH` - State to indicate that the link belongs to a known share but is not accessible at the moment because the remote server indicates that credentials have been updated meanwhile.

              * `ADDABLE_WITH_PASSWORD` - Similar to `ADDABLE` but in addition the user needs to enter a password to add the share.
              * `INACCESSIBLE` - State to indicate that the link belongs to a known share but is inaccessible at the moment.
              * `REMOVED` - State to indicate that the link belongs to a known share but can no longer be accessed.
              * `UNRESOLVABLE` - State to indicate that the share link can't be resolved at all and thus can't be subscribed.
              * `FORBIDDEN` - State to indicate that the subscription of the link is not allowed.
              * `UNSUBSCRIBED` - State to indicate that the link belongs to a known share but is not subscribed at the moment.
