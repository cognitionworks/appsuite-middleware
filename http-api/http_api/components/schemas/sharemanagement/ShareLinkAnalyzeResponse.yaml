              * `CREDENTIALS_REFRESH` - State to indicate that the link belongs to a known share but is not accessible at the moment because the remote server indicates that credentials have been updated meanwhile.

              * `ADDABLE_WITH_PASSWORD` - Similar to `ADDABLE` but in addition the user needs to enter a password to add the share.
