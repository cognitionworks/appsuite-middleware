                 A unique client token to prevent conflicts due to concurrent editing. Must be a 16-character string consisting of [a-zA-Z0-9] only.
                 If set, any request with a different token to check against will fail with MSGCS-0010. Note that requests with clientToken as query
                 parameter will always succeed for backwards-compatibility!
