      The update request can perform an update of the color label and flags of
      one mail object. Beside it

      is possible to change the mail's folder, meaning move the mail to another
      folder. Both operations

      can be performed at once too.


      If neither parameter `id` nor parameter `message_id` is specified, all
      folder's messages are updated

      accordingly.
