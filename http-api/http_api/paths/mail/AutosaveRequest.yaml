        'Contains the rudimentary mail as JSON object as described in [Detailed
        mail data](#detailed-mail-data) with just its message body

        (as html content) defined in nested JSON array `attachments` and its
        header data (from, to,

        subject, etc.). The field "content_type" defines whether the mail ought
        to be sent as plain text

        ("text/plain"), as html ("text/html") or as multipart/alternative
        ("ALTERNATIVE"). Sending a mail

        requires some special fields inside JSON mail object. The field
        "infostore_ids" defines a JSON

        array of infostore document ID(s) that ought to be appended to this mail
        as attachments. The field

        "msgref" indicates the ID of the referenced original mail. Moreover the
        field "sendtype" indicates

        the type of the message: <br> 0 (normal new mail),<br> 1 (a reply mail,
        field `msgref` must be present),<br>

        2 (a forward mail, field `msgref` must be present),<br> 3 (draft edit
        operation, field `msgref` must be

        present in order to delete previous draft message since e.g. IMAP does
        not support changing/replacing

        a message but requires a delete-and-insert sequence),<br> 4 (transport
        of a draft mail, field `msgref`

        must be present),<br> 6 (signals that user intends to send out a saved
        draft message and expects the draft

        message (referenced by `msgref` field) being deleted after successful
        transport). The `csid` field, if it is missing

        from the URL it must then be present in the body.'
