          A JSON object containing an array of objects, each representing a
          conversation's root message along

          with its message thread. The root message's JSON object is filled
          according to the specified `columns`

          and is enhanced by a special `thread` field representing the full
          message thread (including the root

          message itself). `thread` is a JSON array of objects each representing
          a message in the conversation

          sorted by time-line and filled with the specified `columns`. Not IMAP:
          with timestamp. In case of

          errors the responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error
          handling](#error-handling)).
