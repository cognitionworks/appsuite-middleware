          'Contains the rudimentary mail as JSON object as described in [Detailed mail data](#detailed-mail-data) with just its message body
          (as html content) defined in nested JSON array `attachments` and its header data (from, to,
          subject, etc.). The field "content_type" defines whether the mail ought to be sent as plain text
          ("text/plain"), as html ("text/html") or as multipart/alternative ("ALTERNATIVE"). Sending a mail
          requires some special fields inside JSON mail object. The field "infostore_ids" defines a JSON
          array of infostore document ID(s) that ought to be appended to this mail as attachments. The field
          "msgref" indicates the ID of the referenced original mail. Moreover the field "sendtype" indicates
          the type of the message: <br> 0 (normal new mail),<br> 1 (a reply mail, field `msgref` must be present),<br>
          2 (a forward mail, field `msgref` must be present),<br> 3 (draft edit operation, field `msgref` must be
          present in order to delete previous draft message since e.g. IMAP does not support changing/replacing
          a message but requires a delete-and-insert sequence),<br> 4 (transport of a draft mail, field `msgref`
          must be present),<br> 6 (signals that user intends to send out a saved draft message and expects the draft
          message (referenced by `msgref` field) being deleted after successful transport). The `csid` field, if it is missing
          from the URL it must then be present in the body.'
