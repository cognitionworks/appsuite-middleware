    description: >
      The configuration is stored in a tree. Each node of the tree has a name
      and a value.

      The values of leaf nodes are strings which store the actual configuration
      data. The

      values of inner nodes are defined recursively as objects with one field
      for each child node.

      The name and the value of each field is the name and the value of the
      corresponding child

      node, respectively.
