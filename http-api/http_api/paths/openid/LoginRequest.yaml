    summary: Create App Suite session after OpenID login flow
    description: |
      This API call is typically the result of a redirect created by the server. It does not
      need to be explicitly implemented by clients!

      After a successful OpenID login flow, the client (web browser) is redirected
      to this endpoint, where the actual App Suite session gets created. As a result,
      the user gets redirected to `https://<webmail-domain>/<login-path>#session=<session-id>`.
      The redirect response has App Suite session cookies set.
