     When updating a JSlob entry there are two different ways to do so:

     1. Using a path and value field in the request body
     The same as in 1. but the path is provided in the request body as 'path' and the value is provided as 'value'.
     For example:
     <code>
     {
      "path":"path/to/the/sub/tree"
      "value": {...}
     }
     </code>
     2. Performing a merge
     In case no path is given the provided value is merged with the existing jslob entry and only provided fields are updated.

        Either a JSON object which contains the new JSON configuration or a json object which contains a path and value field which provides the JSlob sub path and its value respectively.
        In case the configuration is provided directly it is either merged in case no path is given or it is used to update the subpath.

        Use `/jslob?action=set` to delete fields or entire JSlob.
