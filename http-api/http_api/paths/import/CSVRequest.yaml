      "GÃ¼nther","Mustermann"

      "Hildegard","Musterfrau"

      line must contain the column titles that are related

      to the corresponding fields of the ContactData model (see
      [getContact](#contacts/getContact) request). See [Detailed contact
      data](#detailed-contact-data)

      for a mapping of fields to CSV column titles.
