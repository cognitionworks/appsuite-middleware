          When set to `true`, UIDs are partially ignored during import of tasks
          and appointments from iCal. Internally, each UID is replaced
          statically by a random one to preserve possibly existing relations
          between recurring appointments in the same iCal file, but at the same
          time to avoid collisions with already existing tasks and appointments.

          and `last_modified` of the newly created appointments/tasks.

          In case of errors the JSON object contains the well known [error
          fields](#error-handling). Beside a field `warnings` may contain an
          array

          of objects with warning data containing customary error fields.
