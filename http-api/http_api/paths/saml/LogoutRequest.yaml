    summary: Terminates an App Suite session after SAML logout flow
    description: |
      This API call is typically the result of a redirect created by the server. It does not
      need to be explicitly implemented by clients!

      After a successful SAML logout flow, the client (web browser) is redirected
      to this endpoint, where the actual App Suite session gets terminated. As a result,
      the user gets usually redirected to an environment-specific location, for example
      a portal page. The redirect response removes all App Suite session cookies.
    parameters:
      - in: query
        name: session
        type: string
        description: App Suite session ID
        required: true
