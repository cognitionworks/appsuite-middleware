    summary: Updates an event and its attachments.
    description: >
      #### Note

      It is possible to update multiple attachments at once. Therefore add
      additional form fields and replace "[index]" in `file_[index]` 

      with the appropriate index, like `file_1`. The index always starts with 0
      (mandatory attachment object). There can only be

      one json payload describing the EventData, the rest json payloads (if
      present) will simply be ignored.

      If the event already has attachments, then for each of those attachments
      their valid manageId must be provided as part of the attachment

      metadata. The absense of an already existing attachment for the event will
      result in the deletion of that attachment.
