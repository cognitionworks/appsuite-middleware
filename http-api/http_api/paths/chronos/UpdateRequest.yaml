    summary: Updates an event and its attachments.
    description: |
      #### Note
      It is possible to update multiple attachments at once. Therefore add additional form fields and replace "[index]" in `file_[index]` 
      with the appropriate index, like `file_1`. The index always starts with 0 (mandatory attachment object). There can only be
      one json payload describing the EventData, the rest json payloads (if present) will simply be ignored.
      If the event already has attachments, then for each of those attachments their valid manageId must be provided as part of the attachment
      metadata. The absense of an already existing attachment for the event will result in the deletion of that attachment.
