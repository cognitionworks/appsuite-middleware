    summary: Creates an event and attaches files.

      #### Note
      It is possible to create multiple attachments at once. Therefore add additional form fields and replace "[index]" in `file_[index]` 
      with the appropriate index, like `file_1`. The index always starts with 0 (mandatory attachment object). There can only be
      one json payload describing the EventData, the rest json payloads (if present) will simply be ignored.
