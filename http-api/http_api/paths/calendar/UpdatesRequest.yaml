          An array with new, modified and deleted appointments. New and modified
          appointments are represented by arrays.

          The elements of each array contain the information specified by the
          corresponding identifiers in the

          `columns` parameter. Deleted appointments (should the ignore parameter
          be ever implemented) would be identified

          by their object IDs as integers, without being part of a nested array.
          Appointment sequencies are broken up

          into individual appointments and each modified occurrence of a
          sequence in the requested range is returned

          separately. The appointments are sorted in ascending order by the
          field start_date. In case of errors the

          responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error
          handling](#error-handling)).
