          A JSON object containing an array with appointment data. Each array
          element describes one appointment and

          is itself an array. The elements of each array contain the information
          specified by the corresponding

          identifiers in the `columns` parameter. Appointment sequencies are
          broken up into individual appointments

          and each occurrence of a sequence in the requested range is returned
          separately. The appointments are

          sorted in ascending order by the field `start_date`. In case of errors
          the responsible fields in the

          response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
