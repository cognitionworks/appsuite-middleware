          A JSON object containing an array with data for the requested users. Each array element describes one user and
          is itself an array. The elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding
          identifiers in the `columns` parameter. In case of errors the responsible fields in the response are
          filled (see [Error handling](https://documentation.open-xchange.com/latest/middleware/http_api/1_introduction.html#error-handling)).
