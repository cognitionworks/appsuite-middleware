          An array with new, modified and deleted contacts. New and modified
          contacts are represented by arrays.

          The elements of each array contain the information specified by the
          corresponding identifiers in the

          `columns` parameter. Deleted contacts (should the ignore parameter be
          ever implemented) would be identified

          by their object IDs as integers, without being part of a nested array.
          In case of errors the

          responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error
          handling](#error-handling)).
