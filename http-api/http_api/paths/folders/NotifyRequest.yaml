        JSON object providing the JSON array `entities`, which holds the entity
        ID(s) of the users or groups that

        should be notified. To send a custom message to the recipients, an
        additional JSON object `notification` may

        be included, inside of which an optional message can be passed
        (otherwise, some default message is used).

        (Example: {"entities":["2332"]} or
        {"entities":["2332"],"notification":{"transport":"mail","message":"The
        message"}})
