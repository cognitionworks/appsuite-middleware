          An array with object IDs of folders that were NOT deleted. There may
          be a lot of different causes

          for a not deleted folder: A folder has been modified in the mean time,
          the user does not have the

          permission to delete it or those permissions have just been removed,
          the folder does not exist, etc.

          You receive an empty JSON array if everything worked well. In case of
          errors the responsible fields

          in the response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
