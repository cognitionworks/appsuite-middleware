    responses:
      200:
        description: |
          A JSON object containing three fields: "private", "public, and "shared". Each field is a JSON array with data for all folders. 
          Each folder is itself described by an array. The elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding identifiers in the columns parameter. 
          For the content_type "mail" a JSON object only containing the JSON array "private" is returned. Mail folders are provided by the mail server. Therefore the middleware
          does not "own" the folder and can not know which folders are "public" or "shared" by the mail server. Therfore the middleware handles all mail folders as "private". 
          Nevertheless folders that could be identified as "public" or "shared" will have the identifier within its path. E.g. for the default account paths will look like 
          "default0/public/publicFolder" or "default0/shared/sharedFolder".
          In case of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
