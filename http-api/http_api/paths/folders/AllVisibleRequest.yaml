          A JSON object containing three fields: "private", "public, and
          "shared". Each field is a JSON array with data for all folders. 

          Each folder is itself described by an array. The elements of each
          array contain the information specified by the corresponding
          identifiers in the columns parameter. 

          For the content_type "mail" a JSON object only containing the JSON
          array "private" is returned. Mail folders are managed by the mail
          storage and all are considered 

          to be in private folder namespace for an Open-Xchange user.

          In case of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled
          (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
