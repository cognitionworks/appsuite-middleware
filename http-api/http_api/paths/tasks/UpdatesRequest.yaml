          An array with new, modified and deleted tasks. New and modified tasks
          are represented by arrays. The

          elements of each array contain the information specified by the
          corresponding identifiers in the `columns`

          parameter. Deleted tasks would be identified by their object IDs as
          integers, without being part of

          a nested array. In case of errors the responsible fields in the
          response are filled (see

          [Error handling](#error-handling)).
