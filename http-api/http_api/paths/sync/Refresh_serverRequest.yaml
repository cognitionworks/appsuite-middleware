      #### Note

      Although the request offers to clear multiple folders at once it is
      recommended to clear only one folder per

      request since if any exception occurs (e.g. missing permissions) the
      complete request is going to be aborted.

        description: >
          A JSON object containing an array of folder IDs that could not be
          cleared due to a concurrent modification.

          In case of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled
          (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
