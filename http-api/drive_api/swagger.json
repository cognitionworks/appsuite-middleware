{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"title":"OX Drive API","description":"The module `drive` of OX's HTTP API is used to synchronize files and folders between server and client, using a\nserver-centric approach to allow an easy implementation on the client-side.\n\nThe synchronization is based on checksums for files and folders, differences between the server- and client-side are\ndetermined using a three-way comparison of server, client and previously acknowledged file- and directory-versions.\nThe synchronization logic is performed by the server, who instructs the client with a set of [actions](#action-types-overview) that should be\nexecuted in order to come to a synchronized state.\n\nTherefore, the client takes a snapshot of its local files and directories, calculates their checksums, and sends them as\na list to the server, along with a list of previously acknowledged checksums. The server takes a similar snapshot of\nthe files and directories on the underlying file storages and evaluates which further actions are necessary for\nsynchronization. After executing the server-side actions, the client receives a list of [actions](#action-types-overview) that should be executed\non the client-side. These steps are repeated until the server-state matches the client-state.\n\nKey concept is that the synchronization works stateless, i.e. it can be interrupted and restarted at any time, following\nthe eventual consistency model.\n\nEntry point for the synchronization is the `/drive?action=syncfolders` request, where the directories are compared,\nand further actions are determined by the server, amongst others actions to synchronize the files in a specific\ndirectory using the `/drive?action=syncfiles` request. After executing the actions, the client should send another\n`/drive?action=syncfolders` request to the server and execute the retuned actions (if present), or finish the\nsynchronization if there are no more actions to execute. In pseudo-code, the synchronization routine could be\nimplemented as follows:\n```\nWHILE TRUE\n{\n  response = SYNCFOLDERS()\n  IF 0 == response.actions.length THEN\n    BREAK\n  ELSE\n    EXECUTE(response.actions)\n}\n```\n**Basically, it's up to the client how often such a synchronization cycle is initiated.** For example, he could start a\nnew synchronization cycle after a fixed interval, if he recognizes that the client directories have changed, or if he is\ninformed that something has changed on the server by an event. It's also up to the client to interrupt the synchronization\ncycle at any time during execution of the actions and continue later on, however, it's recommended to start a new\nsynchronization cycle each time to avoid possibly outdated actions.\n\n## File- and directory name restrictions\nRegarding the case sensitivity of file and directory names, OX Drive works in a case-insensitive, but case-preserving way.\nThat means that there cannot be two files with an equal name ignoring case in the same directory, but it's still possible\nto synchronize the names in a case-sensitive manner, as well as it's possible to change only the case of file- and directory\nnames.\n\nThe same applies to equally named files and directories on the same level in the folder hierarchy, i.e. it's not possible to\ncreate a new file in a directory where an equally (ignoring) case named subdirectory already exists and vice versa.\n\nThere is a similar restriction regarding file and directory names in the same directory having different unicode normalization\nforms, yet the same textual representation. OX Drive requires uniqueness regarding this textual representation of potentially\ndifferent encoded unicode strings. So, in case the client tries to synchronize two textually equal files or directories, he\nis instructed to put one of them into quarantine. Internally the server performs an equals-check of the \"NFC\" normalization\nforms of the strings, i.e. an unicde string is normalized using full canonical decomposition, followed by the replacement of\nsequences with their primary composites, if possible. Details regarding unicode normalization can be found at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/tr15-23.html.\n\n### Invalid and ignored filenames\nThere are some filenames that are invalid or ignored and therefore not synchronized. This means that files with these names\nshould not be taken into account when sending the directory contents to the server, or when calculating the directory checksum\n(see [below](#calculation-of-a-directory-s-checksum)). The following list describes when a filename is considered invalid:\n* If it contains one or more of the following reserved characters:\n  * `<` (less than),\n  * `>` (greater than),\n  * `:` (colon),\n  * `\"` (double quote),\n  * `/` (forward slash),\n  * `\\` (backslash),\n  * `|` (vertical bar or pipe),\n  * `?` (question mark),\n  * `*` (asterisk),\n  * characters whose integer representations are in the range from 0 through 31.\n* The last character is a `.` (dot) or ` ` (space).\n* It's case-invariant name without an optional extension matches one of the reserved names `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`, `COM2`,\n  `COM3`, `COM4`, `COM5`, `COM6`, `COM7`, `COM8`, `COM9`, `LPT1`, `LPT2`, `LPT3`, `LPT4`, `LPT5`, `LPT6`, `LPT7`, `LPT8`, or `LPT9`.\n* It consits solely of whitespace characters.\n\nThe following list gives an overview about the ignored filenames:\n* `desktop.ini`,\n* `Thumbs.db`,\n* `.DS_Store`,\n* `icon\\r`,\n* any filename ending with `.drivepart`,\n* any filename starting with `.msngr_hstr_data_` and ending with `.log`.\n\nNevertheless, if the client still insists to send a file version with an invalid or ignored filename, the file creation on the server\nis refused with a corresponding `error` action (see [below](#error)).\n\n### Invalid and ignored directory names\nThere are also similar restrictions regarding invalid directory names. Any try to include them in the list of directory versions will\nbe responded with a corresponding `error` action for the directory version. The following list describes when a path is considered\ninvalid:\n* If it contains one or more of the following reserved characters:\n  * `<` (less than),\n  * `>` (greater than),\n  * `:` (colon),\n  * `\"` (double quote),\n  * `\\` (backslash),\n  * `|` (vertical bar or pipe),\n  * `?` (question mark),\n  * `*` (asterik),\n  * characters whose integer representations are in the range from 0 through 31.\n* The last character of any subpath (i.e. the last part of the whole path or the part preceding the separator character `/`) is a `.`\n  (dot) or ` ` (space).\n* It consists solely of whitespace characters.\n* It not equals the root path `/`, but ends with a `/` (forward slash) character.\n* It contains two or more consecutive `/` (forward slash) characters.\n\nThe following list gives an overview about the ignored directory names:\n* `/.drive`,\n* any directory whose path ends with `/.msngr_hstr_data`.\n\n### Length restrictions\nThe maximum allowed length for path segments, i.e. the parts between forward slashes (`/`) in directory- and filenames, is restricted\nto 255 characters. Synchronizing a file or directory version that contains path segments longer than this limit leads to those versions\nbeing put into quarantine.\n\n## API\nAs part of the OX HTTP API, the basic conventions for exchanging messages described there are also valid for this case, especially\nthe _low level protocol_ and _error handling_. Each request against the OX Drive API assumes a valid server session that is\nuniquely identified by the session ID and the corresponding cookies that are sent with each request. A new session can be\ncreated via the _login module_.\n\nThe root folder plays another important role for the message exchange. The root folder has a unique identifier. It is the\nparent server folder for the synchronization. All path details for directories and files are relative to this folder.\nThis folder's ID is sent with each request. To select the root folder during initial client configuration, the client may\nget a list of synchronizable folders with the `/drive?action=syncfolders` action.\n\n### Calculation of a directory's checksum\nThe checksum of a directory is calculated based on its contents by applying the following algorithm:\n1. Build a list containing each file in the directory (not including subfolders or files in subfolders)\n2. Ensure a lexicographically order in the following way:\n  1. Normalize the filename using the `NFC` normalization form (canonical decomposition, followed by canonical composition) -\n     see http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/tr15-23.html for details\n  2. Encode the filename to an array of UTF-8 unsigned bytes (array of codepoints)\n  3. Compare the filename (encoded as byte array \"fn1\") to another one \"fn2\" using the following comparator algorithm:\n  ```\n  min_length = MIN(LENGTH(fn1), LENGTH(fn2))\n  FOR i = 0; i < min_length; i++\n  {\n    result = fn1[i] - fn2[i]\n    IF 0 != result THEN\n      RETURN result\n  }\n  RETURN LENGTH(fn1) - LENGTH(fn2)\n  ```\n3. Calculate the aggregated MD5 checksum for the directory based on each file in the ordered list:\n  1. Append the file's NFC-normalized (see above) name, encoded as UTF-8 bytes\n  2. Append the file's MD5 checksum string, encoded as UTF-8 bytes\n  \n### Action types overview\n#### acknowledge\nAcknowledges the successful synchronization of a file- or directory versionn, i.e. the client should treat the version as sychronized\nby updating the corresponding entry in its metadata store and including this updated information in all following `originalVersions`\narrays of the `/drive?action=syncfolders`/`/drive?action=syncfiles` actions. Depending on the `version` and `newVersion` parameters\nof the action, the following acknowledge operations should be executed (exemplarily for directory versions, file versions are\nacknowledged in the same way):\n* Example 1: acknowledge a first time synchronized directory\n  The server sends an `acknowledge` action where the newly synchronized directory version is encoded in the `newVersion` field.\n  The client should store the version in his local checksum store and send this version in the `originalVersions` array in upcoming\n  `/drive?action=syncfolders` requests.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"action\": \"acknowledge\",\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"path\": \"/\",\n      \"checksum\": \"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 2: acknowledge a synchronized directory after updates\n  The server sends an `acknowledge` action where the previous directory version is encoded in the `version`, and the newly synchronized\n  directory in the `newVersion` field. The client should replace any previously stored entries of the directory version in his local checksum\n  store with the updated version, and send this version in the `originalVersions` array in upcoming `/drive?action=syncfolders` requests.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"action\": \"acknowledge\",\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"path\": \"/\",\n      \"checksum\": \"7bb1f1a550e9b9ab4be8a12246f9d5fb\"\n    },\n    \"version\": {\n      \"path\": \"/\",\n      \"checksum\": \"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 3: acknowledge the deletion of a previously synchronized directory\n  The server sends an `acknowledge` action where `newVersion` field is set to `null` to acknowledge the deletion of the previously synchronized\n  directory version as found in the `version` field. The client should remove any stored entries for this directory from his local checksum\n  store, and no longer send this version in the `originalVersions` array in upcoming `/drive?action=syncfolders` requests.\n  Note that an acknowledged deletion of a directory implicitly acknowledges the deletion of all contained files and subfolders, too, so the\n  client should also remove those `originalVersions` from his local checksum store.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"action\": \"acknowledge\",\n    \"version\": {\n      \"path\": \"/test\",\n      \"checksum\": \"3525d6f28eb8cb30eb61ab7932367c35\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### edit\nInstructs the client to edit a file- or directory version. This is used for move/rename operations. The `version` field is set to the version\nas sent in the `clientVersions` array of the preceding `/drive?action=syncfolders`/`/drive?action=syncfiles` request. The `newVersion` contains\nthe new name/path the client should use. Unless the optional boolean parameter `acknowledge` is set to `false` and `edit` action implies that\nthe client updates its known versions store accordingly, i.e. removes the previous entry for `version` and adds a new entry for `newVersion`.\nWhen editing a directory version, the client should implicitly take care to create any not existing subdiectories in the `path` of the `newVersion`\nfield. A concurrent client-side modification of the file/directory version can be detected by the client by comparing the current checksum\nagainst the one in the passed `newVersion` field.\n* Example 1: rename a file\n  The server sends an `edit` action where the source file is encoded in the `version`, and the target file in the `newVersion` field. The client should\n  rename the file identified by the `version` field to the name found in the `newVersion` field. Doing so, the stored checksum entry for the file\n  in `version` should be updated, too, to reflect the changes.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"path\": \"/\",\n    \"action\": \"edit\",\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"name\": \"test_1.txt\",\n      \"checksum\": \"03395a94b57eef069d248d90a9410650\"\n    },\n    \"version\": {\n      \"name\": \"test.txt\",\n      \"checksum\": \"03395a94b57eef069d248d90a9410650\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 2: move a directory\n  The server sends an `edit` action where the source directory is encoded in the `version`, and the target directory in the `newVersion` field.\n  The client should move the directory identified by the `version` field to the path found in the `newVersion` field. Doing so, the stored\n  checksum entry for the directory in `version` should be updated, too, to reflect the changes.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"action\": \"edit\",\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"path\": \"/test2\",\n      \"checksum\": \"3addd6de801f4a8650c5e089769bdb62\"\n    },\n    \"version\": {\n      \"path\": \"/test1/test2\",\n      \"checksum\": \"3addd6de801f4a8650c5e089769bdb62\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 3: rename a conflicting file\n  The server sends an `edit` action where the original client file is encoded in the `version`, and the target filename in the `newVersion` field. The\n  client should rename the file identified by the `version` field to the new filename found in the `newVersion` field. If the `acknowledge` field\n  is set to `true` or is not set, the stored checksum entry for the file in `version` should be updated, too, to reflect the changes, otherwise,\n  as in this example, no changes should be done to the stored checksums.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"action\": \"edit\",\n    \"version\": {\n      \"checksum\": \"fade32203220752f1fa0e168889cf289\",\n      \"name\": \"test.txt\"\n    },\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"checksum\": \"fade32203220752f1fa0e168889cf289\",\n      \"name\": \"test (TestDrive).txt\"\n    },\n    \"acknowledge\": false,\n    \"path\": \"/\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### download\nContains information about a file version the client should download. For updates of existing files, the previous client version is supplied in the\n`version` field. For new files, the `version` field is omitted. The `newVersion` holds the target file version, i.e. filename and checksum, and should\nbe used for the following `/drive?action=download` request. The `totalLength` field is set to the file size in bytes, allowing the client to recognize\nwhen a download is finished. Given the supplied checksum, the client my decide on its own if the target file needs to be downloaded from the server,\nor can be created by copying a file with the same checksum to the target location, e.g. from a trash folder. The file's content type can be retrieved\nfrom the `contentType` field, similar to the file's creation and modification times that are available in the `created` and `modified` fields.\n* Example 1: download a new file\n  The server sends a `download` action where the file version to download is encoded in the `newVersion` field. The client should download and save the file\n  as indicated by the `name` property of the `newVersion` in the directory identified by the supplied `path`. After downloading, the `newVersion` should\n  be added to the client's known file versions database.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"totalLength\": 536453,\n    \"path\": \"/\",\n    \"action\": \"download\",\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"name\": \"test.pdf\",\n      \"checksum\": \"3e0d7541b37d332c42a9c3adbe34aca2\"\n    },\n    \"contentType\": \"application/pdf\",\n    \"created\": 1375276738232,\n    \"modified\": 1375343720985\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 2: download an updated file\n  The server sends a `download` action where the previous file version is encoded in the `version`, and the file version to download in the `newVersion`\n  field. The client should download and save the file as indicated by the `name` property of the `newVersion` in the directory identified by the supplied\n  `path`, replacing the previous file. After downloading, the `newVersion` should be added to the client's known file versions database, replacing an\n  existing entry for the previous `version`.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"totalLength\": 1599431,\n    \"path\": \"/\",\n    \"action\": \"download\",\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"name\": \"test.pdf\",\n      \"checksum\": \"bb198790904f5a1785d7402b0d8c390e\"\n    },\n    \"contentType\": \"application/pdf\",\n    \"version\": {\n      \"name\": \"test.pdf\",\n      \"checksum\": \"3e0d7541b37d332c42a9c3adbe34aca2\"\n    },\n    \"created\": 1375276738232,\n    \"modified\": 1375343720985\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### upload\nInstructs the client to upload a file to the server. For updates of existing files, the previous server version is supplied in the `version` field, and\nshould be used for the following `/drive?action=upload` request. For new files, the `version` field is omitted. The `newVersion` holds the target file\nversion, i.e. filename and checksum, and should be used for the following `/drive?action=upload` request. When resuming a previously partly completed upload,\nthe `offset` field contains the offset in bytes from which the file version should be uploaded by the client. If possible, the client should set the\n`contentType` field for the uploaded file, otherwise, the content type falls back to `application/octet-stream`.\n\n#### remove\nInstructs the client to delete a file or directory version. The `version` field contains the version to delete. A deletion also implies a removal of the\ncorresponding entry in the client's known versions store. A concurrent client-side modification of the file/directory version can be detected by comparing\nthe current checksum against the one in the passed `version` field.\n* Example 1: remove a file\n  The server sends a `remove` action where the file to be removed is encoded as `version` field. The `newVersion` field is not set int the action. The\n  client should delete the file identified by the `version` field. A stored checksum entry for the file in `version` should be removed, too, to reflect\n  the changes.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"path\": \"/test2\",\n    \"action\": \"remove\",\n    \"version\": {\n      \"name\": \"test.txt\",\n      \"checksum\": \"03395a94b57eef069d248d90a9410650\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 2: remove a directory\n  The server sends a `remove` action where the directory to be removed is encoded as `version` field. The `newVersion` field is not set in the action.\n  The client should delete the directory identified by the version parameter. A stored checksum entry for the directory in `version` should be removed,\n  too, to reflect the changes.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"action\": \"remove\",\n    \"version\": {\n      \"path\": \"/test1\",\n      \"checksum\": \"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### sync\nThe client should trigger a synchronization of the files in the directory supplied in the `version` field using the `/drive?action=syncfiles` request.\nA `sync` action implies the client-side creation of the referenced directory if it not yet exists, in case of a new directory on the server. If the\n`version` field is not specified, a synchronization of all folders using the `/drive?action=syncfolders` request should be initiated by the client.\nIf the `reset` flag in the action is set to `true`, the client should reset his local state before synchronizing the files in the directory. This may\nhappen when the server detects a synchronization cycle, or believes something else is going wrong. Reset means that the client should invalidate any\nstored original checksums for the directory itself and any contained files, so that they get re-calculated upon the next synchronization. If the `reset`\nflag is set a the action without a specific directory version, the client should invalidate any stored checksums, so that all file- and directory-versions\nget re-calculated during the following synchronizations.\n* Example 1: synchronize folder\n  The server sends a `sync` action with a `version`. The client should trigger a `/drive?action=syncfiles` request for the specified folder.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sync\",\n    \"version\": {\n      \"path\": \"<folder>\",\n      \"checksum\": \"<md5>\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 2: synchronize all folders\n  The server sends a `sync` action without `version` (or version is `null`). The client should trigger a `/drive?action=syncfolder` request, i.e. the\n  client should synchronize all folders.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"action\": \"sync\",\n    \"version\": null\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### error\nWith the `error` action, file- or directory versions causing a synchronization problem can be identified. The root cause of the error is encoded in\nthe `error` field as described in _error handling_ of the OX HTTP API.\n\nBasically, there are two scenarios where either the errorneous version affects the synchronization state or not. For instance, a file that was deleted\nat the client without sufficient permissions on the server can just be downloaded again by the client, and afterwards, client and server are oin-sync\nagain. On the other hand, e.g. when creating a new file at the client and this file can't be uploaded to the server due to missing permissions, the client\nis out of sync as long as the file is present. Therefore, the boolean field `quarantine` instructs the client whether the file or directory version must\nbe excluded from the synchronization or not. If it is set to `true`, the client should exclude the version from the `clientVersions` array, and indicate\nthe issue to the enduser. However, if the synchronization itself is not affected and the `quarantine` flag is set to `false`, the client may still\nindicate the issue once to the user in the background, e.g. as a balloontip notification.\n\nThe client may reset it's quarantined versions on it's own, e.g. if the user decides to \"try again\", or automatically after a configurable interval.\n\nThe server may also decide that further synchronization should be suspended, e.g. in case of repeated synchronization problems. Such a situation is\nindicated with the parameter `stop` set to `true`. In this case, the client should at least cancel the current synchronization cycle. If appropriate,\nthe client should also be put into a 'paused' mode, and the user should be informed accordingly.\n\nThere may also be situations where a error or warning is sent to the client, independently of a file- or directory version, e.g. when the client version\nis outdated and a newer version is available for download.\n\nThe most common examples for errors are insufficient permissions or exceeded quota restrictions, see examples below.\n* Example 1: create a file in a read-only folder\n  The server sends an `error` action where the errorneous file is encoded in the `newVersion` field and the `quarantine` flag is set to `true`. The\n  client should execlude the version from the `clientVersions` array in upcoming `/drive?action=syncfiles` requests so that it doesn't affect the\n  synchronization algorithm. The error message and further details are encoded in the `error` object of the response.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"error\": {\n      \"category\": 3,\n      \"error_params\": [\"/test\"],\n      \"error\": \"You are not allowed to create files at \\\"/test\\\"\",\n      \"error_id\": \"1358320776-69\",\n      \"categories\": \"PERMISSION_DENIED\",\n      \"code\": \"DRV-0012\"\n    },\n    \"path\": \"/test\",\n    \"quarantine\": true,\n    \"action\": \"error\",\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"name\": \"test.txt\",\n      \"checksum\": \"3f978a5a54cef77fa3a4d3fe9a7047d2\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 2: delete a file without sufficient permissions\n  Besides a new `download` action to restore the locally deleted file again, the server sends an `error` action where the errorneous file is encoded\n  in the `newVersion` field and the `quarantine` flag is set to `false`. Further synchronizations are not affected, but the client may still inform the\n  user about the rejected operation. The error message and further details are encoded in the `error` object of the response.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"error\": {\n      \"category\": 3,\n      \"error_params\": [\"test.png\", \"/test\"],\n      \"error\": \"You are not allowed to delete the file \\\"test.png\\\" at \\\"/test\\\"\",\n      \"error_id\": \"1358320776-74\",\n      \"categories\": \"PERMISSION_DENIED\",\n      \"code\": \"DRV-0011\"\n    },\n    \"path\": \"/test\",\n    \"quarantine\": false,\n    \"action\": \"error\",\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"name\": \"test.png\",\n      \"checksum\": \"438f06398ce968afdbb7f4db425aff09\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 3: upload a file that exceeds the quota\n  The server sends an `error` action where the errorneous file is encoded in the `newVersion` field and the `quarantine` flag is set to `true`. The client\n  should exclude the version from the `clientVersions` array in upcoming `/drive?action=syncfiles` requests so that it doesn't affect the synchronization\n  algorithm. The error message and further details are encoded in the `error` object of the response.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"error\": {\n      \"category\": 3,\n      \"error_params\": [],\n      \"error\": \"The allowed Quota is reached\",\n      \"error_id\": \"-485491844-918\",\n      \"categories\": \"PERMISSION_DENIED\",\n      \"code\": \"DRV-0016\"\n    },\n    \"path\": \"/\",\n    \"quarantine\": true,\n    \"action\": \"error\",\n    \"newVersion\": {\n      \"name\": \"test.txt\",\n      \"checksum\": \"0ca6033e2a9c2bea1586a2984bf111e6\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* Example 4: synchronize with a client where the version is no longer supported\n  The server sends an `error` action with code \"DRV-0028\" and an appropriate error message.

Those exclusion filters are then taken into account during\nsynchronization, i.e. files and directories matching a defined exclusion pattern are ignored when comparing the list of server-, client- and original versions. Also,\nthe file exclusion lists are considered for the calculation of aggergated directory checksums.\n\nThe exclusion filters may be set, changed or unset at any time during synchronization, there are no additional requests needed to set them up. Instead, the list of\nexcluded files and directories is simply sent along with each `/drive?action=syncfolders`, `/drive?action=syncfiles` and `/drive?action=download` request.\n\n### Pattern types\nA pattern currently may be defined in two formats: `exact` or `glob`.\n* `exact`\n  An exact pattern, matching the file- or directory version literally. For example, to exclude the file \"Backup.pst\" in the subfolder \"Mail\" below the root synchronization\n  folder, an `exact` file pattern would look like: `{\"path\":\"/Mail\",\"name\":\"Backup.pst\",\"type\":\"exact\"}`, or, an exact directory pattern for the directory \"/Archive\"\n  would be represented as `{\"path\":\"/Archive\",\"type\":\"exact\"}`.\n* `glob`\n  A simple pattern allowing to use the common wildcards \\* and ? to match file- and directory versions. For example, to exclude all files ending with \".tmp\" across all\n  directories, the `glob` file pattern could be defined as `{\"path\":\"*\",\"name\":\"*.tmp\",\"type\":\"glob\"}`, or, to exclude the directory \"/Project/.git\" and all its\n  subdirectories recursively, this would be expressed using a combination of the following two directory patterns:\n  `[{\"path\":\"/Project/.git\",\"type\":\"exact\"},{\"path\":\"/Project/.git*\",\"type\":\"glob\"}]`.\n  \n### Further considerations\n* It's possible to exclude a (parent) directory with an appropriate pattern, while still subfolders below that directory being synchronized. This usually results in the\n  excluded directory being created by both client- and server-side, but no file contents within the excluded directory being exchanged. If subfolders should be excluded,\n  too, a wildcard should be used in the pattern to match any subdirectories.\n* If the client tries to synchronize a file- or directory version that is ignored, i.e. a version that would match any of the provided exclusion filters, the server\n  behaves similarly to the handling of invalid and ignored file- and directory names (see above), i.e. the client would be instructed to put those versions into quarantine.\n* For the calculation of directory checksums, it's important that the server and client perform exactly the same matching for ignored filenames: A * character matches zero\n  or more characters, a ? character matches exactly one character. All other characters are matched literally. Advanced glob flavors like braces to define subpattern\n  alternatives or square brackets for character sets are not used.\n* Client-side filtering is available since API version 2. The API version that is supported by the server is included in the response of the `/drive?action=settings` request.\n* Whenever there are active exclusion filters, the `/drive?action=syncfolders` request should contain all of both directory and file exclusion filter lists. For the\n  `/drive?action=syncfiles` request, it's sufficient to include the list of file exclusions.\n  \n## Metadata synchronization\nThe synchronization of metadata is available **since API version 3**.\n### Introduction\nPreviously, only the \"raw\" folders and files were synchronized between server and clients. While this is sufficient for basic synchronization, there are cases where the\nclients could benefit from additional data - \"metadata\" - that is already available on the server. For example, clients could display directories that have been shared\nor published to other people in a different way. Or, clients could consider folder permissions directly in case the user is performing a local change that would be rejected\nby the server in the next synchronization cycle anyway.\n\nTo supply the clients with those additional information without any influence on the existing synchronization protocol (!), `.drive-meta` files are introduced for each\nsynchronized directory. Regarding synchronization, such files are treated like any other ordinary file. Especially, those files are taken into account when it comes to\ndirectory checksum calculation. Doing so, metadata updates result in a changed `.drive-meta` file, which in turn causes the parent directory checksum to change, hence\nsynchronization is triggered.\n\nHowever, some special handling applies for those files:\n* Clients are not allowed to change metadata, so modifications of metadata files or the deletion of them is rejected. Recovery is done via the protocol here, i.e. the client\n  is instructed to re-download the file.\n* `.drive-meta` files are actually not stored physically on the file storage backend, but created on the fly based on the actual metadata of the directory.\n* Client applications may either store such files on the client file system, or evaluate and store the contained metadata information in a local database for later retrieval.\n  If the file is not saved physically on the client (which is actually recommended), the client is responsible to consider the metadata file in a virtual way and include\n  it's checksum for the directory checksum calculation - similar to the server's internal handling.\nNote: Embedded metadata synchronization is enabled by default, but can be forcibly disabled by setting the `driveMeta` parameter to `false` in each request.\n\n### Metadata format\nThe metadata in `.drive-meta` files is serialized in JSON format to allow easy processing at the clients. The following shows an example of the contents:\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": \"/\",\n  \"localized_name\": \"Meine Dateien\",\n  \"own_rights\": 403710016,\n  \"permissions\": [{\n    \"bits\":

at least 3 in order to include `.drive-meta` during synchronization.\n* Evaluate `.drive-meta` files and store the information, as well as the file's checksums in a local database.\n* Include this file in the calculation of the parent directory checksum, just like an ordinary file in that directory.\n* Do something useful with the metadata information.\n\n### Additional notes\n* The metadata synchronization via `.drive-meta` files embedded into the synchronization protocol obsoletes the previously used methods to receive metadata information\n  (see `/drive?action=fileMetadata` request and `columns` parameter in `/drive?action=syncfiles`).\n* Depending on the underlying file storage backend, the included metadata may vary, so each information should be treated as optional.\n* Embedded metadata synchronization is enabled by default, but can be forcibly disabled by setting the `driveMeta` parameter to `false` in each request.\n\n### Possible use cases\n* For files where the `locked` property is `true`, display some kind of \"lock\" icon (-overlay) in the file list / explorer view.\n* For files or folders where the `shared` property is `true`, display some kind of \"cloud\" icon (-overlay) in the file list / explorer view.\n* For files or folders where the user is not allowed to perform an action with, don't offer such actions (e.g. if a file cannot be deleted or renamed by the user due to\n  insufficient permissions, disable the corresponding options).\n* Use the URLs in `preview` and `thumbnail` to get a preview image for the files.\n* Display the server creation / last modification timestamps of files and folders.\n* Embed a version history for files with multiple versions.\n* Show to which users a file or folder is currently shared.\n* Offer appropriate \"jump\" actions to the groupware web interface for more advanced options (e.g. to directly edit an .xlsx file in the spreadsheet application of the\n  web interface, or to manage a folder's permission).\n___\n","contact":{"name":"Open-Xchange
