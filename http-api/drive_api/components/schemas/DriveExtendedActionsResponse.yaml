      synchronization.
      If the `diagnostics` parameter was set, quota

      equal or grater than 8, the array is wrapped into an additional JSON 
      object in the field `actions`. The path to the root folder is indicated
      in `pathToRoot`. If requested, the diagnostics trace is provided at 
      `diagnostics`, quota information at `quota`.

      will carry the metadata in an additional JSON object in `data` field 
      of `action`. In case of errors the responsible fields in the response 
      are filled.
