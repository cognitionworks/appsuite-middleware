        description: |
          A JSON object containing an array of actions the client should execute for synchronization. If the
          `diagnostics` parameter was set, the array is wrapped into an additional JSON object in the field
          `actions` and the diagnostics trace is provided at `diagnostics`. If `driveMeta` was set to `inline`,
          `download` actions for `.drive-meta` will carry the metadata in an additional JSON object in `data`
          field of `action`. In case of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled.
