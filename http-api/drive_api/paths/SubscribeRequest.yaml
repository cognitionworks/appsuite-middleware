    summary: Subscribes to push events.
    description: |
      Registers a client device to receive push notifications from the server. The subscription is performed based on
      the configured root folder ID of the client application that identifies itself with it's device token. Supported
      services currently include the Apple Push Notification Service (APN) and Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). Trying
      to perform an identical subscription (same `root`, `service`, and `token`) from the same user account again
      is treated as a no-op.
