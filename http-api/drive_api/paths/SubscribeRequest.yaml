    summary: Subscribes to push events.
    description: >
      Registers a client device to receive push notifications from the server.
      The subscription is performed based on

      the configured root folder ID of the client application that identifies
      itself with it's device token. Supported

      services currently include the Apple Push Notification Service (APN) and
      Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). Trying

      to perform an identical subscription (same `root`, `service`, and `token`)
      from the same user account again

      is treated as a no-op.
