          A JSON object containing the fields `folder` and `notification`. The JSON object in field `folder` describes
          the updated directory metadata (currently only the property `permissions` is considered) and the JSON object `notification`
          may include a message to notify added permission entities. To notify with a default message, an empty `notification`
          object should still be added.
