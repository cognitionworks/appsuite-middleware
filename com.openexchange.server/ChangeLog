   To disable this option please use
   CHECK_AND_REMOVE_PAST_REMINDERS=FALSE

   The second one (CHECK_AND_AVOID_SOLO_REMINDER_TRIGGER_EVENTS)
   checks if only the reminder was changed. If this is true we avoid to trigger
   the event because this is a private field and no mail must be send and no
   client must be informed.

   instances fetched from cache do not change cached instance
 - Modularity: Added additional folder permission checks on folder creation/update:
   -> Sharing of a private folder is forbidden if user's config denies
