# Searching for contacts can be done in a single folder or globally across all folders. Searching across all folders can cause high server
# and database load because first all visible folders must be determined and if a user has object read permissions in that folders. Software
# internal default is true to prevent high load if the property is not defined. Default here is false because it is easier for the user to
# find contacts.

# The auto complete search for email addresses may be triggered easily and quite often if a new email is written and a part of a recipients
# address is written. This can lead to high load on the database system if a context has a lot of users and a lot of contacts. Therefore the
# scope if this search can be configured. Set this parameter to true and the auto complete search looks in every readable contact folder for
# contacts with emails addresses matching the already typed letters. If this parameter is configured to false, only three folders are
# considered for the search: the users private default contact folder, his contact folder for collected contacts and the global address book
# if that is enabled for the user.

# Configures the maximum image dimension to use when serializing contacts to 
# vCards in the format [max_width]x[max_height]. Larger images will be resized
# dynamically to fit the specified rectangular area. If left empty, images are
# not resized at all and serialized as-is.

# Specifies whether the original files are persisted during vCard import or 
# CardDAV synchronization. If enabled, the original vCard files will be stored 
# in the appropriate filestore and are considered during export again. If 
# disabled, all not mapped information is discarded and is no longer available
# when exporting the vCard again. 
# Defaults to "true". 
com.openexchange.contact.storeVCards=true

# Configures the maximum allowed size of a (single) vCard file in bytes.
