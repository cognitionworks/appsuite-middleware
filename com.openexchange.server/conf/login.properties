# Configuration of the login

# Configures if some user is able to reenter his existing session after closing the browser tab or the complete browser. Setting this to
# true may be a security risk for clients running on unsafe computers. If this is configured to true, check that the parameter client
# contains the same identifier the UI sends as client parameter on normal login request. Otherwise the backend will not be able to
# rediscover the users session after closing the browser tab. This parameter only applies to the HTTP authorization header based login
# request.
com.openexchange.ajax.login.http-auth.autologin=false

# Every client tells the backend through the client parameter on the login request his identity. This is not possible when using the HTTP
# authorization header based login. So the client identifier for that request is defined here. It must be the same identifier that the web
# frontend uses, if you set com.openexchange.cookie.hash to calculate and want the previously configured autologin to work.
# Identifier for web UI is: com.openexchange.ox.gui.dhtml
com.openexchange.ajax.login.http-auth.client=com.openexchange.ox.gui.dhtml

# The version of the client when using the HTTP Authorization Header based login. This should not be the normal web frontend version because
# a different version can be used to distinguish logins through HTTP authorization header and normal login request.
com.openexchange.ajax.login.http-auth.version=HTTP Auth

# Configures which error page should be used for the login. The error page is only applied for the HTML Form login and the HTTP
# Authorization Header login. All other login related requests provide normal JSON responses in error cases. The built-in error page shows
# the error message for 5 seconds and then redirects to the referrer page.

# Configures whether an insecure login is allowed. Meaning if local IP and/or user-agent strings are replaced in associated user session on
# login redirect or login redeem requests. To create a session from a server for some client you have to pass the clients IP address when
# creating the session.
# WARNING! Setting this parameter to true may result in users seeing a different users content if the infrastructure around OX does not work
# correctly.
com.openexchange.ajax.login.insecure=false

# This option has only an effect if com.openexchange.ajax.login.insecure is configured to true.
# This option allows to enable the IP check for /ajax/login?action=redirect requests. This request is mostly used to create a session
# without using the OX web UI login screen. The previous behavior allowed to change the IP for this request. Configure this option to false
# to have an IP check during this request. Additionally you can white list IP addresses from that an IP change is still allowed. This is
# useful if other systems in the infrastructure around OX want to create the session.
