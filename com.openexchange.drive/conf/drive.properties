# Properties for com.openexchange.drive

# Enables or disables the "drive" module capability globally.
com.openexchange.capability.drive=true

# Specifies whether the synchronization logic will make use of a folder named 
# ".drive" below the root synchronization folder or not. If enabled, this 
# folder is used to store temporary uploads and removed files, which usually
# leads to a better user experience since previously synchronized files can
# be restored from there for example. If not, removed files are not kept, and
# uploads are performed directly in the target folder.
# Defaults to "true".

# Configures the pattern for direct links to files. Text in brackets is 
# replaced dynamically during link generation in the backend, however, it's 
# still possible to overwrite them here with a static value.

# the server tries to determine the hostname on it's own), [uiwebpath] is 
# replaced with the value of "com.openexchange.UIWebPath" as defined in 
# "server.properties". [object] and [folder] are replaced with the relevant 
# IDs to generate the direct link. Defaults to
# "https://[hostname]/[uiwebpath]#m=infostore&f=[folder]&i=[object]".

# Configures the pattern for a direct link to manage a user's quota. Text in

# Indicates which APNS service is used when sending push notifications. A
