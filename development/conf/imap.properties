# Define where to sort emails: Value "imap" to let the  IMAP Server sort (faster but less reliable).
# Leave blank or fill in value "application" to sort within application (slower but good quality).

# This property determines whether a fast fetch is performed on large mail
# folders or not. Although the fetch is fast on IMAP side, a lot of data is
# transfered during reading response which cause a temporary memory peak.
# If disabled only the necessary fields are used as command arguments,
# which is slower but needs less memory.
# NOTE: See property "imapMessageFetchLimit" to know which mail folders are
# treated as large mail folders

# Enable/disable mbox format: A mail folder can only either hold subfolders or hold messages.
# Furthermore the folder type on creation is determined by the folder name. If folder name
# ends with the server-defined folder separator character its type is HOLDS-FOLDERS; otherwise
# its type is HOLDS-MESSAGES.
# Note that there's currently an unresolved problem concerning deletion of mail folders. Since
# the trash folder is created to hold only messages, no backup of the deleted folder can be
# copied to trash folder; meaning the folder in question (including messages, its subfolders,
# and subfolders' contents) is irretrievably lost.

# IMAP operations which shall be applied to a number of messages which exceeds the block size
# are performed in blocks. Example: A folder containing thousands of messages shall be cleared.
# To avoid the risk of an IMAP timeout when trying to delete all messages at once, the messages
# are deleted in block size portions.
