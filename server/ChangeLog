 - Added new feature that the conflict handling can be disabled.
   If the conflict flag is false, no conflict resolution or detection 
   is done, even if a resource is booked. This can lead into 
   overbooking of resources and this is not a bug but a feature.

 - Added new  feature that the free/busy handling can be disabled.
   If the free/busy flag is false, no free/busy results are returned, 
   even if the requested user or resource has appointments in
   the given timeframe. This is not a bug but a feature.

 - Fixed bug #8290. A multi span whole day account was 
   sometimes shown wrong in the mini calendar. This 
   could happen if the start of the appointment is before
   the start of the mini calendar. This has been fixed.

   is not in the first week after the start one occurrence is not calculated.
   This has been fixed.

   provided by the free/busy interface. This has been fixed.

* 2007-07-04 - martin.kauss@open-xchange.com

   element which VCARD considers a mail object, but of course
   it does not pass the check for a proper mail adress (VCard is
   more tolerant than us).
 - Fixed bug #7703 (importer). Surprisingly, I could use the logic
   of WEEKLY occurrences for DAILY ones, too. A one line fix...

* 2007-07-03 - martin.kauss@open-xchange.com

 - Fixed bug #6910. Moving a personal appointment into
   a shared sub folder did not moved the appointment.
   This has been fixed.

 - Fixed bug 7738. New config options exists in the filecalendar.properties,
   both are true by default.

   The first one (CHECK_AND_REMOVE_PAST_REMINDERS)
   checks if a reminder is in the past and removes the reminder from the object.
   To disable this option please use
   CHECK_AND_REMOVE_PAST_REMINDERS=FALSE

   The second one (CHECK_AND_AVOID_SOLO_REMINDER_TRIGGER_EVENTS)
   checks if only the reminder was changed. If this is true we avoid to trigger
   the event because this is a private field and no mail must be send and no
   client must be informed.
   To disable this option please use
   CHECK_AND_AVOID_SOLO_REMINDER_TRIGGER_EVENTS=FALSE

* 2007-07-03 - thorben.betten@open-xchange.com

   shared folder according to the suggestions posted in comment #11:

   GUI's permission composer dialog.

   - AJP_WATCHER_MAX_RUNNING_TIME defines the amount of milliseconds
   	after which a stack trace is logged

   implementation stores/returns cloned versions. Therefore altered
   instances fetched from cache do not change cached instance
 - Modularity: Added additional folder permission checks on folder creation/update:
   -> Sharing of a private folder is forbidden if user's config denies
      full shared folder access.
   -> Permissions defined for a folder are checked against entity's
      user config to ensure its applicability. Currently an exception
      is thrown but can be changed to any other handling.

   Also checking for empty personal in MailComparator when comparing email addresses

  - Added a handy new sub package to allow for bulk entries of contacts,
    found in ...contacts.helpers. Might seem a bit strange to use, but
    Hibernate does it kinda he same way. You'll get used to it.
  - Added two basic CSV handling classes - one of them a parser. Can be found
    in ...importerexporter.csv - maybe useful for other projects.
  - Further Work on importers and exporters. Okay, we agreed not to mention 
    new development, but since I was already typing and even the 
    system.properties.in has been updated, which usually is worth an e-mail...
