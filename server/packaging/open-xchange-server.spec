   creating user gets the permissions (excl. folder admin) as composed by
   GUI's permission composer dialog.

 - Fixed bug 7738. New config options exists in the filecalendar.properties,
   both are true by default.
   The first one (CHECK_AND_REMOVE_PAST_REMINDERS)
   checks if a reminder is in the past and removes the reminder from the object.
   To disable this option please use
   CHECK_AND_REMOVE_PAST_REMINDERS=FALSE
   The second one (CHECK_AND_AVOID_SOLO_REMINDER_TRIGGER_EVENTS)
   checks if only the reminder was changed. If this is true we avoid to trigger
   the event because this is a private field and no mail must be send and no
   client must be informed.
   To disable this option please use
   CHECK_AND_AVOID_SOLO_REMINDER_TRIGGER_EVENTS=FALSE

   - AJP_WATCHER_MAX_RUNNING_TIME defines the amount of milliseconds
   	after which a stack trace is logged

    in ...importerexporter.csv - maybe useful for other projects.

    new development, but since I was already typing and even the 
    system.properties.in has been updated, which usually is worth an e-mail...
