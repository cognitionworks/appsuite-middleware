Create a task with a user as participant

|Table:Create task|
| Demo fixture    |
| title     | start_date | end_date | users  |
| Nice Task | 08:30 AM   | 10:30 AM | marcus |


Expect that this participant is saved, too. And unlike an appointment, the creator is not a participant.

|Table:Verify task|
| Demo fixture    |
| title     | start_date | end_date | users  |
| Nice Task | 08:30 AM   | 10:30 AM | marcus |


Add another user participant

|Table:Update task|
| Demo fixture    |
| users           |
| marcus, thorben |


Check that nothing got lost and the update succeeded.

|Table:Verify task|
| Demo fixture    |
| title     | start_date | end_date | users           |
| Nice Task | 08:30 AM   | 10:30 AM | marcus, thorben |
