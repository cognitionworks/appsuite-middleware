!2 Default folder names
The OX translates names of folder for the convenience of users. While usually useful, this does not help tests to run on systems with different default languages and such. So what one system might call "Public folders", the next might name "Ã–ffentliche Ordner". This does not influence the naming of newly created folders, but only default folders. To target these, we have a separate handling mechanism: Folders prefixed with # are considered system folders. The following folder names do exist:
 * SYSTEM
  * GLOBAL
  * PUBLIC
  * PRIVATE
  * SHARED
  * INFOSTORE
   * PUBLIC_INFOSTORE
   * USER_INFOSTORE
  * LDAP

The default order we do look up a folder name is
 1 Names defined in the fixture itself
 1 Names already existing on the OX
 1 The names given above
