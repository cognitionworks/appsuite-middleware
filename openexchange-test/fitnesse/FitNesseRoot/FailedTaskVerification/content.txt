''This test shows how a failed verification looks.''

To do this, we create a task:

!|Table:CreateTask|
| fixturename | title     | start_date | end_date | note |
| Demo fixture| Nice Task | 08:30 AM   | 10:30 AM | Nice note |

And then we try to verify this task, but sadly, we are looking for the wrong title!
Oh dear, this test is going to fail. Badly.

!|Table:VerifyTask|
| fixturename | title     | start_date | end_date | note |
| Demo fixture| Ugly Task | 08:30 AM   | 10:30 AM | Ugly note |

Luckily, we are even told what is wrong and what was expected, so we could try to fix it.
But here you can see that this test fails only once. We made a mistake at the note, too.
But that was not shown.

But anyhow, if you fix the first mistake, the second mistake will show its ugly face:

!|Table:VerifyTask|
| fixturename | title     | start_date | end_date | note |
| Demo fixture| Nice Task | 08:30 AM   | 10:30 AM | Ugly note |
