# Starts all core threads, causing them to idly wait for work.
# This overrides the default policy of starting core threads only when new tasks are executed. 
com.openexchange.threadpool.prestartAllCoreThreads=true

# The maximum number of threads to allow in the pool.
# Default is max. integer value of 2^31 - 1 which is considered as unlimited max. number of threads.

# When the number of threads is greater than the core, this is the maximum

# The queue type to use for holding tasks before they are executed. This queue will
# hold only the tasks submitted by the execute method.
# Supported values: synchronous and linked
# A synchronous queue is an appropriate choice when "com.openexchange.threadpool.maximumPoolSize"
# is unlimited and possible rejection of tasks is allowed.
# A linked queue is an appropriate choice when "com.openexchange.threadpool.maximumPoolSize"
# is limited and rejection of tasks is prohibited.

# The size of the work queue. Zero means unlimited size.
# Note: If this property is set to a value greater than zero, property "com.openexchange.threadpool.workQueue"
# is implicitly set to "linked" to accomplish a fixed-size thread pool.

# The default behavior to obey when execution is blocked because the thread bounds and queue
# capacities are reached.
# Supported values: abort, caller-runs, discard
# abort: Aborts execution by throwing an appropriate exception to the caller
# caller-run: The caller is considered to run the task if thread pool is unable to do so
# discard: The task is silently discarded. No exception is thrown.
